\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {I need to know the strengths and weaknesses of Capital Boost\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s case. Capital Boost\u8217\'92s general counsel and I agree that we would like to support and defend the management\u8217\'92s decision if we have a strong legal basis to do so. Conversely, if Capital Boost violated Barat\u8217\'92s rights, I would like to enter settlement negotiations as soon as possible. }}
