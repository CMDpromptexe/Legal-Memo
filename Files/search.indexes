            <Text>DISCUSSION

It Is Likely That Capital Boost Did Not Violate Title VII Because It Offered a Facial Accommodation Barat Rejected and Faced Significant Operational Burdens That Support an Undue Hardship Defense.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars employers from discharging employees due to their religion and additionally requires employers to accommodate the religious beliefs and practices of their employees once they are notified of meaningful conflicts present due to their duties as an employee. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Once notified, it becomes the burden of the employer to demonstrate that it has offered reasonable accommodation or that accommodation(s) would impose an undue burden upon an employer Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 470, (2023); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j).
This section evaluates whether Capital Boost met its obligations to provide reasonable accommodation to Mr. Barat on October 15, 2024. It additionally evaluates the likelihood of Capital Boost successfully arguing that further accommodation would have imposed an undue burden to the company.

            <Text>Capital Boost’s Accommodation Offering Was Likely Unreasonable, As The Prayer Break Terms Did Not Provide Barat Sufficient Opportunity To Fulfill His Religious Duties. The Boiler Room Also Appears Questionable As An Adequate Prayer Space Even With Improvements.
A reasonable accommodation requires that the employee is given the ability to fulfill their religious duties and practices. However, this accommodation does have to be a “total” accommodation, nor must it be the preferred option for the employee Tabura v. Kellogg USA, 880 F.3d 544, 550 (10th Cir. 2018). The court appears to define reasonable as an accommodation that, at a minimum, allows the employee the opportunity to fully resolve the conflict by their own efforts. If the employee would be unable to resolve the conflict between religious duties and  work duties, it is not reasonable CASE; However, if the facts would support a finding that the employee would be able to fulfill both duties though additional efforts of their own, then the accommodation would be considered reasonable even if the accommodation is a minor one on the part of the employer. TWA v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 80 (1977).
The controlling case for this is Tabura v. Kellogg USA, in which two Seventh Day Adventists had been accommodated by their employer by allowing the pair to swap shift or used paid time off to avoid working on otherwise mandatory Saturday shifts. The court reversed a summary judgment ruling in favor of Kellogg as it determined that the the reasonableness of the accommodation need be determined by a jury. The issue of fact in contention was not if Kellogg had completely eliminated the conflict in duties, but rather, if the employees were able to exercise reasonable effort to eliminate the issue through their own bargaining. Similar to this the court more directly —— A case similar to the fact pattern at hand is Christmon v. B&amp;B Airparts, Inc., 735 F. App'x 510, 512 (10th Cir. 2018). While  —
When applied to Capital Boost are Barat, there are some key facts that would likely preclude Capital Boost from succeeding in a claim that the accommodation was reasonable. Capital Boost’s accommodation for Barat, was allowing prayer in the boiler room, using break time alloted by the written rules. This did not include periods of time where staff meeting were occurring, which Barat Would be required to attend in full.

Case Summary




Overview
HOLDINGS: [1]-In a former employee's religious discrimination case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the district court did not err in considering a deposition transcript submitted by the employer. The employer filed the certification required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(f)(1) when the employee raised the issue; [2]-The employee's claim failed because allowing the employee to skip mandatory Saturday overtime shifts after he explained his religious concern constituted a reasonable accommodation. The employer was not required to offer the employee his preferred accommodation of making up the overtime hours on Sunday.
Outcome
Judgment affirmed.

A plaintiff bears the initial burden to show a prima facie case of religious discrimination for failure to accommodate. The plaintiff must show that he has a bona fide religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement, informed the employer of this belief, and was fired for failure to comply with the conflicting employment requirement. If the plaintiff satisfies his burden, the burden will shift to the employer, which will need to conclusively rebut an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case, show the offering of a reasonable accommodation, or show an inability to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's religious beliefs without undue hardship.

Opinion




 [*511]  ORDER AND JUDGMENT*10th Cir. R. 34.1(G)
* 
Mr. Jerome Christmon sued his former employer (B&amp;B Airparts, Inc.) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  [*512]  claiming discrimination for failure to accommodate religious practices. Mr. Christmon is a Hebrew Israelite and regards Saturday as the Sabbath. Nonetheless, Mr. Christmon was required to work mandatory overtime shifts on some Saturdays. Because of his beliefs, Mr. Christmon asked to work his overtime hours on Sundays instead of Saturdays. B&amp;B Airparts told Mr. Christmon that if he needed time off for religious reasons, he had to complete a &quot;Request for Time Off form.&quot;
Mr. Christmon did not submit the form. Instead, he simply stopped coming to work when he was assigned Saturday shifts. B&amp;B Airparts did not take any disciplinary action, and Mr. Christmon admits that he was not required to work on Saturdays. [**2]  But he remained dissatisfied because he lost the opportunity to earn overtime hours, which he would have kept if he had been assigned shifts on Sunday. Mr. Christmon was ultimately fired for violating B&amp;B Airparts' sexual harassment policy.
After the firing, Mr. Christmon sued under Title VII, claiming that B&amp;B Airparts had discriminated against him by failing to change his weekend shifts from Saturdays to Sundays. On this claim, the district court granted summary judgment to B&amp;B Airparts, holding that it had provided a reasonable accommodation to Mr. Christmon.
Mr. Christmon appeals, arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because
• B&amp;B Airparts had submitted an uncertified deposition transcript with the summary-judgment motion,
• B&amp;B Airparts had failed to submit any interrogatory responses, and
• the record had not shown a reasonable accommodation.
We reject these arguments. B&amp;B Airparts provided undisputed evidence that Mr. Christmon's deposition was certified, no obligation existed to support the summary-judgment motion with interrogatory responses, and B&amp;B Airparts provided a reasonable accommodation by allowing Mr. Christmon to miss his Saturday shifts. [**3]  For these reasons, we affirm.
I. Standard of Review
We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. Knopf v. Williams, 884 F.3d 939, 946 (10th Cir. 2018). Summary judgment is appropriate &quot;if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In applying this standard, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Mr. Christmon. See Knopf, 884 F.3d at 946.
II. Evidentiary Issues
Mr. Christmon argues that the district court erred by (1) relying on uncertified testimony from Mr. Christmon's deposition and (2) granting B&amp;B Airparts' motion even though it had not been supported by interrogatory responses. Mr. Christmon's arguments fail because B&amp;B Airparts (1) presented undisputed evidence that Mr. Christmon's deposition transcript had been certified and (2) was not required to support the motion with interrogatory responses.
 [*513]  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(f)(1) requires that deposition transcripts be accompanied by a certification &quot;that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness's testimony.&quot; Mr. Christmon argues that the district court could not consider his deposition testimony because B&amp;B Airparts had filed a transcript lacking [**4]  the required certification.
For this argument, Mr. Christmon relies on three opinions from the Southern District of Ohio: Moore v. Florida Bank of Commerce, 654 F. Supp. 38 (S.D. Ohio 1986), Morphew v. Lawhon &amp; Assocs., No. 2:10-cv-716, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141518, 2011 WL 6122638 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 8, 2011), and Soliday v. Miami Cty., No. C-3-91-153, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21311, 1993 WL 1377511 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 22, 1993). Reliance on these opinions is misguided because in these cases, the parties relying on the deposition testimony failed to provide the court with a deposition certification. Moore, 654 F. Supp. at 41 n.2; Morphew, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141518, 2011 WL 6122638 at *2; Soliday, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21311, 1993 WL 1377511 at *5 n.4.1D. Kan. R. 56.1(d)  Here, B&amp;B Airparts filed the certification when the plaintiffs raised the issue. Because the certification was filed, the district court did not err in considering the deposition testimony.
Mr. Christmon also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because B&amp;B Airparts had failed to support its motion with interrogatory responses. But Rule 56 did not require B&amp;B Airparts to support its motion with interrogatory responses. Thus, Mr. Christmon's argument fails.
III. Reasonable Accommodation
Mr. Christmon argues that the district court erred in holding that B&amp;B Airparts had provided a reasonable accommodation. We disagree. The undisputed evidence shows that B&amp;B Airparts allowed Mr. Christmon to skip mandatory Saturday shifts after he had explained his religious concern. [**5]  This relief from Saturday shifts constituted a reasonable accommodation, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to B&amp;B Airparts.
Mr. Christmon bears the initial burden to show a prima facie case of religious discrimination for failure to accommodate. Thomas v. Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers, 225 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 2000). Mr. Christmon must show that he
• has a &quot;bona fide religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement,&quot;
• informed B&amp;B Airparts of this belief, and
• &quot;was fired for failure to comply with the conflicting employment requirement.&quot;
Id. If Mr. Christmon satisfies his burden, the burden would shift to B&amp;B Airparts, which would need to
• conclusively rebut an element of Mr. Christmon's prima facie case,
• show the offering of a reasonable accommodation, or
• show an inability to reasonably accommodate Mr. Christmon's religious beliefs without undue hardship.
Id. at 1156. The district court assumed that Mr. Christmon had met his burden and decided as a matter of law that B&amp;B Airparts' accommodation had been reasonable. We agree.
 [*514]  &quot;'Accommodate . . . means . . . allowing the plaintiff to engage in [his] religious practice despite the employer's normal rules to the contrary.'&quot; Tabura v. Kellogg USA, 880 F.3d 544, 550 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2032 n.2, 192 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015) (omissions in original)). But a reasonable [**6]  accommodation does not necessarily spare an employee from any resulting cost. Pinsker v. Joint Dist. No. 28J, 735 F.2d 388, 390-91 (10th Cir. 1984). Thus, the accommodation may be reasonable even though it is not the one that the employee prefers. Id. at 390.
The undisputed evidence shows that
• B&amp;B Airparts required its employees to work overtime shifts on Saturdays when scheduled,
• before informing his supervisor of his need for religious accommodation, Mr. Christmon had been disciplined for failing to appear for a Saturday shift, and
• once Mr. Christmon had told his supervisor about the conflict between his religious beliefs and the Saturday shifts, B&amp;B Airparts allowed Mr. Christmon to skip Saturday shifts with no disciplinary consequences.
See R. at 141 (deposition testimony of Mr. Christmon stating that B&amp;B Airparts &quot;basically just allowed me to not come in on my scheduled Saturdays&quot;).
Though Mr. Christmon requested an opportunity to make up his overtime hours on Sunday, Title VII did not require B&amp;B Airparts to offer Mr. Christmon's preferred accommodation. B&amp;B Airparts' accommodation allowed Mr. Christmon to avoid the conflict with his religious beliefs even if he lost the opportunity for overtime. See Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 70, 107 S. Ct. 367, 93 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986) (&quot;[U]npaid leave eliminates the [**7]  conflict between employment requirements and religious practices by allowing the individual to observe fully religious holy days and requires him only to give up compensation for a day that he did not in fact work.&quot;); Pinsker v. Joint Dist. No. 28J, 735 F.2d 388, 391 (10th Cir. 1984) (&quot;Defendant's policy, although it may require teachers to take occasional unpaid leave, is not an unreasonable accommodation of teachers' religious practices.&quot;).2  Thus, the district court did not err in deciding that B&amp;B Airparts had provided Mr. Christmon with a reasonable accommodation.
IV. Conclusion
We conclude that
• the district court did not err in considering Mr. Christmon's deposition testimony even though B&amp;B Airparts' motion had not initially included the certification,
• B&amp;B Airparts was not required to support its summary-judgment motion with interrogatory responses, and
• the undisputed evidence shows that B&amp;B Airparts provided a reasonable accommodation.
 [*515]  Accordingly, we affirm the district [**8]  court's grant of summary judgment to B&amp;B Airparts.

Prior History:  [****1]  CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT 
Disposition: The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court and found no violation of the civil rights laws because appellant had tried in a variety of ways to accommodate respondent employee, whose religious beliefs prohibited him from working on Saturdays. 
Case Summary




Procedural Posture
Appellant employer challenged reversal of a judgment from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, holding appellant had not satisfied its duty to accommodate and had committed an unlawful employment practice under § 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-2(a)(1).
Overview
Appellant was an airline that operated a large maintenance and overhaul base. Respondent was an employee of appellant's who was prohibited from working on Saturday due to religious tenets. Appellant would not or could not accommodate respondent's need to be off on Saturday. Thereafter, respondent filed a discrimination action the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Reversing the appeals court, which found appellant violated the Act, the court held that appellant did not violate the Act. In fact, the court noted that appellant tried to accommodate respondent by meeting with him to discuss alternatives, attempting to find someone to swap shifts with respondent, and attempting to find respondent another job. It was the union, not the employer, that was more unyielding. The court concluded that there was not even a suggestion of discriminatory intent in this case.
Outcome
The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court and found no violation of the civil rights laws because appellant had tried in a variety of ways to accommodate respondent employee, whose religious beliefs prohibited him from working on Saturdays.

HN1 Section 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-2(a)(1), makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee or a prospective employee on the basis of his or her religion. A guideline of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 29 C.F.R. § 1605.1(b) (1968), requires, as the Act itself now does, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e (j), that an employer, short of &quot;undue hardship,&quot; make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; to the religious needs of its employees.

HN7 The paramount concern of Congress in enacting Title VII, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-2, was the elimination of discrimination in employment. In the absence of clear statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court will not readily construe the statute to require an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their Sabbath.

Summary
An employee whose religion required him to observe his Sabbath day on Saturday, was discharged when he refused to work on Saturdays. Although the employee had earlier held a job with the employer where the employee had sufficient seniority to allow him to avoid Saturday work, when the employee sought and received a transfer to a different job with the employer, the employee was placed near the bottom of a new seniority list. Due to his low seniority on the new job, the employee was called upon to work on Saturdays. Although the employer agreed to permit the union to seek a change of work assignments for the employee, the union was unwilling to violate the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The employer refused to unilaterally violate the seniority provisions and also refused to allow the employee to work only 4 days a week, since this would have required either (1) filling his position with a supervisor or an employee from another area and would have undermanned another operation, or (2) employing someone not regularly assigned to work Saturdays, thus requiring the payment of premium wages. Following his discharge, the employee brought an action for injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, alleging that his discharge constituted religious discrimination in violatio of 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-2(a)(1)). The District Court ruled in favor of the employer and the union (375 F Supp 877), but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the employer had not satisfied its duty to accommodate the religious needs of the employee (527 F2d 33).
On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. In an opinion by White, J., joined by Burger, Ch. J., and Stewart, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist, and Stevens, JJ., it was held that (1) the employer had made reasonable efforts to accommodate the religious needs of the employee, (2) the employer was not required to violate the collective bargaining agreement to accommodate the employee by violating the seniority system which was not shown to have a discriminatory purpose, and (3) the alternative plans, which would have permitted the employee to avoid Saturday work by working only 4 days per week, constituted an undue hardship on the employer.
Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J., dissented, expressing the view that the employer did not prove that it exhausted all reasonable accommodations and that the only remaining alternatives would have caused undue hardship on the employer's business.

Although ordinarily an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guideline--such as one requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of their employees and prospective employees where such accommodation can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business--is not entitled to great weight where it varies from prior Commission policy and no new legislative history has been introduced in support of the change, nevertheless, where Congress has not just kept its silence by refusing to overturn the administrative construction, but has ratified it with positive legislation, the guideline is entitled to some deference; it is at least sufficient to warrant the court's accepting the guideline as a defensible construction of the statute, prior to its amendment, as imposing upon an employer the duty of reasonable accommodation in the absence of undue hardship.

An employer who discharged an employee who refused to work on Saturday, his Sabbath day, did not violate 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--which makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate in employment on the basis of religion--by not, in the alternative, (1) permitting the employee to work a 4-day week, utilizing in his place a supervisor or other worker on duty elsewhere, (2) filling the employee's Sabbath day shift from other available personnel competent to do the job, or (3) arranging a swap with another employee either for another shift or for the Sabbath days, since the employer made reasonable efforts to accommodate the employee and each of the alternatives would have been an undue hardship within the meaning of the statute as construed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines--which provided that employers must make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of employees and prospective employees where such accommodation can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business--in that (1) as to the first alternative, the employer would have been required to replace the employee with supervisory personnel or with qualified personnel from other departments which would mean lost efficiency in other jobs, (2) as to the second alternative, the employer would have been required to replace the employee with other available employees at premium wages, and (3) as to the third alternative, both the union and the employer had agreed to the seniority system, the union was unwilling to entertain a variance over the objections of men senior to the employee in question, and for the employer to have arranged unilaterally for a swap would have amounted to a breach of the collective bargaining agreement.

A seniority system under which the most senior employees have first choice of job and shift assignments, and the most junior employees are required to work when the union steward is unable to find enough people willing to work at a particular time or in a particular job to fill the employer's needs, represents, under 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-2(a)(1))--which makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate in employment on the basis of religion--a significant accommodation to the needs, both religious and secular, of all of the employer's employees.

To require an employer to bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give an employee his Sabbath days off is an undue hardship under an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guideline which interpreted 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--which makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate in employment on the basis of religion--as requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of employees and prospective employees where such accommodation can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business; to require an employer to bear additional costs when no such costs are incurred to give other employees the days off that they want would involve unequal treatment of employees on the basis of their religion.

 RIGHTS §7.5  &gt; employment discrimination --  &gt; Headnote:LEdHN[14] [14]
Since the paramount concern of Congress in enacting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) was the elimination of discrimination in employment, in the absence of clear statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, the statute will not be construed to require an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their Sabbath.  
Syllabus




Respondent Hardison (hereafter respondent) was employed by Trans World Airlines (TWA), petitioner in No. 75-1126, in a department that operated 24 hours a day throughout the year in connection with an airplane maintenance and overhaul base.  Respondent was subject to a seniority system in a collective-bargaining agreement between TWA and the International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers (union), petitioner in No. 75-1385, whereby the most senior employees have first choice for job and shift assignments as they become available, and the most junior employees are required to work when enough employees to work at a particular time or in a particular job to fill TWA's needs cannot be found.  Because respondent's religious beliefs prohibit him from working on Saturdays, attempts were made to accommodate him, and these were temporarily successful mainly because on his job at the time he had sufficient seniority regularly to observe Saturday as his Sabbath.  But when he sought, and was transferred to, another job where [****2]  he was asked to work Saturdays and where he had low seniority, problems began to arise.  TWA agreed to permit the union to seek a change of work assignments, but the union was not willing to violate the seniority system, and respondent had insufficient seniority to bid for a shift having Saturdays off.  After TWA rejected a proposal that respondent work only four days a week on the ground that this would impair critical functions in the airline operations, no accommodation could be reached, and respondent was discharged for refusing to work on Saturdays.  Then, having first invoked the administrative remedy provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, respondent brought an action for injunctive relief against TWA and the union, claiming that his discharge constituted religious discrimination in violation of § 703(a)(1) of the Act, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of his religion. He also made certain other charges against the union.  His claim of religious discrimination was based on the 1967 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines in effect at the time requiring an employer,  [****3]  short of &quot;undue hardship,&quot; to make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; to the religious needs of its employees, and on similar language in the 1972 amendments to Title VII.  The District Court ruled in favor of both TWA and the union, holding that the union's duty to accommodate respondent's religious beliefs did not require it to ignore the seniority system, and that TWA had satisfied its &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; obligation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for the union but reversed the judgment for TWA, holding that TWA had not satisfied its duty to accommodate respondent's religious needs under the EEOC guidelines. The court took the view that TWA had rejected three reasonable alternatives, any one of which would have satisfied its obligation without undue hardship: (1) Within the framework of the seniority system, TWA could have permitted respondent to work a four-day week, utilizing a supervisor or another worker on duty elsewhere, even though this would have caused other shop functions to suffer; (2) TWA could have filled respondent's Saturday shift from other available personnel, even though this would have involved premium overtime pay; and (3) TWA could have arranged [****4]  a &quot;swap&quot; between respondent and another employee either for another shift or for the Sabbath days, even though this would have involved a breach of the seniority system.  Held: TWA, which made reasonable efforts to accommodate respondent's religious needs, did not violate Title VII, and each of the Court of Appeals' suggested alternatives would have been an undue hardship within the meaning of the statute as construed by the EEOC guidelines. Pp. 76-85.  
(a) The seniority system itself represented a significant accommodation to the needs, both religious and secular, of all of TWA's employees.  Pp. 77-78.  
(b) TWA itself cannot be faulted for having failed to work out a shift or job swap for respondent.  Both the union and TWA had agreed to the seniority system; the union was unwilling to entertain a variance over the objections of employees senior to respondent; and for TWA to have arranged unilaterally for a swap would have breached the collective-bargaining agreement.  An agreed-upon seniority system is not required to give way to accommodate religious observances, and it would be anomalous to conclude that by &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; Congress meant that an employer must deny [****5]  the shift and job preferences of some employees, as well as deprive them of their contractual rights, in order to accommodate or prefer the religious needs of others.  Title VII does not require an employer to go that far.  Pp. 79-81.  
(c) Under § 703(h) of Title VII, absent a discriminatory purpose, the operation of a seniority system cannot be an unlawful employment practice even if the system is discriminatory in its effect.  Pp. 81-82.  
(d) To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give respondent Saturdays off would be an undue hardship, for, like abandonment of the seniority system, to require TWA to bear additional costs when no such costs are incurred to give other employees the days off that they want would involve unequal treatment of employees on the basis of their religion. Absent clear statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, the statute, the paramount concern of which is to eliminate discrimination in employment, cannot be construed to require an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their Sabbath.  Pp. 84-85.

Opinion




 [*66]  [***120]  [**2268]     MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court. 
Section 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(a)(1), makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee or a prospective employee on the basis of his or her religion. At the time of the events involved here, a guideline of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 29 CFR § 1605.1(b) (1968), required, as the Act itself now does, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e (j) (1970 ed., Supp. V), that an employer, short of &quot;undue hardship,&quot; make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; to the religious needs of its employees.  The issue in this case is the extent of the employer's obligation under Title VII to accommodate an employee whose religious beliefs prohibit him from working on Saturdays.  
I 
We summarize briefly the facts found by the Distirct [****8]  Court.  375 F.Supp. 877 (WD Mo. 1974). 
Petitioner Trans World Airlines (TWA) operates a large maintenance and overhaul base in Kansas City, Mo.  On June 5, 1967, respondent Larry G. Hardison was hired by TWA to work as a clerk in the Stores Department at its Kansas City base.  Because of its essential role in the Kansas City operation, the Stores Department must operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, and whenever an employee's job in that department is not filled, an employee must be  [*67]  shifted from another department, or a supervisor must cover the job, even if the work in other areas may suffer.  
Hardison, like other employees at the Kansas City base, was subject to a seniority system contained in a collective-bargaining agreement 1


*  that TWA maintains with petitioner International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).  2  The seniority system is implemented by the union steward through a system of bidding by employees for particular shift assignments as they become available.  The most senior employees have first choice for job and  [***121]  shift assignments, and the most junior employees are required to work when the union steward [****9]  is unable to find enough people willing to work at a particular time or in a particular job to fill TWA's needs.  
In the spring of 1968 Hardison began to study the religion known as the Worldwide Church of God.  One of the tenets of that religion is that one must observe the [****10]  Sabbath by refraining from performing any work from sunset on Friday until sunset on Saturday.  The religion also proscribes work on certain specified religious holidays. 
When Hardison informed Everett Kussman, the manager of the Stores Department, of his religious conviction regarding  [*68]  observance of the Sabbath, Kussman agreed that the union steward should seek a job swap for Hardison or a change of days off; that Hardison would have his religious holidays off whenever possible if Hardison agreed to work the traditional holidays when asked; and that Kussman would try to find Hardison another job that would be more compatible with his religious beliefs.  The problem was temporarily solved when Hardison transferred to the 11 p.m.-7 a.m.  [**2269]  shift.  Working this shift permitted Hardison to observe his Sabbath.  
The problem soon reappeared when Hardison bid for and received a transfer from Building 1, where he had been employed, to Building 2, where he would work the day shift.  The two buildings had entirely separate seniority lists; and while in Building 1 Hardison had sufficient seniority to observe the Sabbath regularly, he was second from the bottom on the [****11]  Building 2 seniority list.  
In Building 2 Hardison was asked to work Saturdays when a fellow employee went on vacation.  TWA agreed to permit the union to seek a change of work assignments for Hardison, but the union was not willing to violate the seniority provisions set out in the collective-bargaining contract, 3  and Hardison had insufficient seniority to bid for a shift having Saturdays off.  
A proposal that Hardison work only four days a week was rejected by the company.  Hardison's job was essential, and on weekends he was the only available person on his [****12]  shift to perform it.  To leave the position empty would have impaired supply shop functions, which were critical to airline operations; to fill Hardison's position with a supervisor or an  [*69]  employee from another area would simply have undermanned another operation; and to employ someone not regularly assigned to work Saturdays would have required TWA to pay premium wages.  
When an accommodation was not reached, Hardison refused to report for work on Saturdays.  A transfer to the twilight shift proved unavailing since that schedule still required Hardison to work past sundown on Fridays.  After a hearing, Hardison  [***122]  was discharged on grounds of insubordination for refusing to work during his designated shift.  
Hardison, having first invoked the administrative remedy provided by Title VII, brought this action for injunctive relief in the United States District Court against TWA and IAM, claiming that his discharge by TWA constituted religious discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(a)(1).  He also charged that the union had discriminated against him by failing to represent him adequately in his dispute with TWA [****13]  and by depriving him of his right to exercise his religious beliefs.  Hardison's claim of religious discrimination rested on 1967 EEOC guidelines requiring employers &quot;to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of employees&quot; whenever such accommodation would not work an &quot;undue hardship,&quot; 29 CFR § 1605.1 (1968), and on similar language adopted by Congress in the 1972 amendments to Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e(j) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  
After a bench trial, the District Court ruled in favor of the defendants.  Turning first to the claim against the union, the District Court ruled that although the 1967 EEOC guidelines were applicable to unions, the union's duty to accommodate Hardison's belief did not require it to ignore its seniority system as Hardison appeared to claim.  4Establishment Clause of the First Amendment375 F.Supp. 877, 883 (WD Mo. 1974)  As for Hardison's  [*70]  claim against TWA, the District Court rejected at the outset TWA's contention that requiring it in any way to accommodate the religious needs of its employees would constitute an unconstitutional establishment of religion. As the District Court construed the Act, however,  [**2270]  TWA had satisfied its &quot;reasonable [****14]  accommodations&quot; obligation, and any further accommodation would have worked an undue hardship on the company.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the judgment for TWA.  527 F.2d 33 (1975). It agreed with the District Court's constitutional ruling, but held that TWA had not satisfied its duty to accommodate. Because it did not appear that Hardison had attacked directly the judgment in favor of the union, the Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment [****15]  without ruling on its substantive merits.  
In separate petitions for certiorari TWA and IAM contended that adequate steps had been taken to accommodate Hardison's religious observances and that to construe the statute to require further efforts at accommodation would create an establishment of religion contrary to the First Amendment of the Constitution.  TWA also contended that the Court of Appeals improperly ignored the District Court's findings of fact.  
We granted both petitions for certiorari.  429 U.S. 958 (1976). Because we agree with petitioners that their conduct was not a violation of Title  [***123]  VII, 5  we need not reach the other questions presented.  
 [****16]  [*71]   II
 LEdHN[1] [1]The Court of Appeals found that TWA had committed an unlawful employment practice under § 703(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(a)(1), which provides: S
&quot;(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer - 
&quot;(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot;I 

The emphasis of both the language and the legislative history of the statute is on eliminating discrimination in employment; similarly situated employees are not to be treated differently solely because they differ with respect to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  6McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 278-279 (1976)Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 763 (1976)McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800 (1973)Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430 (1971)
id., at 58  This is true regardless of whether  [*72]  the discrimination is directed against majorities or minorities.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976). [****17]  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971).
 [****18]  The prohibition against religious discrimination soon raised the question of whether  [**2271]  it was impermissible under § 703(a)(1) to discharge or refuse to hire a person who for religious reasons refused to work during the employer's normal workweek.  In 1966 an EEOC guideline dealing with this problem declared that an employer had an obligation under the statute &quot;to accommodate to the reasonable religious needs of employees… where such accommodation can be made without serious inconvenience to the conduct of the  [***124]  business.&quot; 29 CFR § 1605.1 (1967).  
In 1967 the EEOC amended its guidelines to require employers &quot;to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of employees and prospective employees where such accommodations can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.&quot; 29 CFR § 1605.1 (1968).  The EEOC did not suggest what sort of accommodations are &quot;reasonable&quot; or when hardship to an employer becomes &quot;undue.&quot; 729 CFR § 1605.1 (1968)  
 [****19]    [*73]   LEdHN[2A] [2A]This question -- the extent of the required accommodation - remained unsettled when this Court, in Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 402 U.S. 689 (1971), affirmed by an equally divided Court the Sixth Circuit's decision in 429 F.2d 324 (1970). The discharge of an employee who for religious reasons had refused to work on Sundays was there held by the Court of Appeals not to be an unlawful employment practice because the manner in which the employer allocated Sunday work assignments was discriminatory in neither its purpose nor effect; and consistent with the 1967 EEOC guidelines, the employer had made a reasonable accommodation of the employee's beliefs by giving him the opportunity to secure a replacement for his Sunday work.  8LEdHN[2B]
Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 192 (1972)Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36 (1974)  
 [****20]   LEdHN[3] [3]In part &quot;to resolve by legislation&quot; some of the issues raised in Dewey, 118 Cong. Rec. 706 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Randolph), Congress included the following definition of religion in its 1972 amendments to Title VII: S
&quot;The term 'religion' includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable,o reasonably accommodate  [*74]  to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue  [***125]  hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.&quot; § 701(j), 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e(j) (1970 ed., Supp. V).I 
The intent and effect of this definition was to make it an unlawful employment practice under § 703(a)(1) for an employer not to make reasonable accommodations, short  [**2272]  of undue hardship, for the religious practices of his employees and prospective employees.  But like the EEOC guidelines, the statute provides no guidance for determining the degree of accommodation [****21]  that is required of an employer.  The brief legislative history of § 701(j) is likewise of little assistance in this regard.  9

402 U.S. 689 (1971)  The proponent of the measure, Senator Jennings  [*75]  Randolph, expressed his general desire &quot;to assure that freedom from religious discrimination in the employment of workers is for all time guaranteed by law,&quot; 118 Cong. Rec. 705 (1972), but he made no attempt to define the precise circumstances under which the &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; requirement would be applied.1Williams v. Southern Union Gas Co., 529 F.2d 483 (CA10 1976)Reid v. Memphis Publishing Co., 521 F.2d 512 (CA6 1975)Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service, 497 F.2d 128 (CA5 1974)Draper v.

 [****22]  In brief, the employer's statutory  [***126]  obligation to make reasonable accommodation for the religious observances of its employees, short of incurring an undue hardship, is clear, but the reach of that obligation has never been spelled out by Congress or by EEOC guidelines. With this in mind, we turn to a consideration of whether TWA has met its obligation  [*76]  under Title VII to accommodate the religious observances of its employees.  
III
 LEdHN[4A] [4A]The Court of Appeals held that TWA had not made reasonable efforts to accommodate Hardison's religious needs under the 1967 EEOC guidelines in effect at the time the relevant events occurred.  1LEdHN[4B]
General Electric Co.  v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 140-145 (1976)Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381-382 (1969)1  In  [**2273]  its view, TWA had rejected three reasonable alternatives, any one of which would have satisfied its obligation without undue hardship. First, within the framework of the seniority system, TWA could have permitted Hardison to work a four-day week, utilizing in his place a supervisor or another worker on duty elsewhere.  That this would have caused other shop functions to suffer was insufficient to amount to undue hardship in the opinion of [****23]  the Court of Appeals.  Second -- according to the Court of Appeals, also within the bounds of the collective-bargaining contract -- the company could have filled Hardison's Saturday shift from other available personnel competent to do the job, of which the court said there were at least 200.  That this would have involved premium overtime pay was not deemed an undue hardship.Third, TWA could have arranged a &quot;swap between Hardison and another employee either for another shift or for the Sabbath days.&quot; In response to the assertion that this would have involved a breach of the seniority  [*77]  provisions of the contract, the court noted that it had not been settled in the courts whether the required statutory accommodation to religious needs stopped short of transgressing seniority rules, but found it unnecessary to decide the issue because, as the Court of Appeals saw the record, TWA had not sought, and the union had therefore not declined to entertain, a possible variance from the seniority provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement.  The company had simply left the entire matter to the union steward who the Court of Appeals said &quot;likewise did nothing.&quot; 
 LEdHN[5A] [5A]  [****25]  We disagree with the Court of Appeals in all relevant respects.  It is our view that TWA made reasonable efforts to accommodate and that each of the Court of Appeals' suggested alternatives would have been an undue hardship within the meaning of the statute as construed by the EEOC guidelines. 
 [***127]  A 
It might be inferred from the Court of Appeals' opinion and from the brief of the EEOC in this Court that TWA's efforts to accommodate were no more than negligible.  The findings of the District Court, supported by the record, are to the contrary.  In summarizing its more detailed findings, the District Court observed: S
&quot;TWA established as a matter of fact that it did take appropriate action to accommodate as required by Title VII.  It held several meetings with plaintiff at which it attempted to find a solution to plaintiff's problems.  It did accommodate plaintiff's observance of his special religious holidays. It authorized the union steward to search for someone who would swap shifts, which apparently was normal procedure.&quot; 375 F.Supp., at 890-891.I 

It is also true that TWA itself attempted without success to find Hardison another job.  The District [****26]  Court's view was that TWA had done all that could reasonably be expected within the bounds of the seniority system.  
 [*78]  The Court of Appeals observed, however, that the possibility of a variance from the seniority system was never really posed to the union.  This is contrary to the District Court's findings and to the record.  The District Court found that when TWA first learned of Hardison's religious observances in April 1968, it agreed to permit the union's steward to seek a swap of shifts or days off but that &quot;the steward reported that he was unable to work out scheduling  [**2274]  changes and that he understood that no one was willing to swap days with plaintiff.&quot; Id., at 888. Later, in March 1969, at a meeting held just two days before Hardison first failed to report for his Saturday shift, TWA again &quot;offered to accommodate plaintiff's religious observance by agreeing to any trade of shifts or change of sections that plaintiff and the union could work out?.Any shift or change was impossible within the seniority framework and the union was not willing to violate the seniority provisions set out in the contract to make a shift or change.&quot; Id., at 889. [****27]  As the record shows, Hardison himself testified that Kussman was willing, but the union was not, to work out a shift or job trade with another employee.  App. 76-77.  
 LEdHN[6] [6]We shall say more about the seniority system, but at this juncture it appears to us that the system itself represented a significant accommodation to the needs, both religious and secular, of all of TWA's employees.  As will become apparent, the seniority system represents a neutral way of minimizing the number of occasions when an employee must work on a day that he would prefer to have off.  Additionally, recognizing that weekend work schedules are the least popular, the company made further accommodation by reducing its work force to a bare minimum on those days.  
B
 LEdHN[5B] [5B]We are also convinced, contrary to the Court of Appeals, that TWA itself cannot be faulted for having failed to work  [*79]  out a shift or job swap for Hardison.  Both the union and TWA had agreed to the seniority system; the union was unwilling to entertain a variance over the objections [****28]  of men senior to Hardison;  [***128]  and for TWA to have arranged unilaterally for a swap would have amounted to a breach of the collective-bargaining agreement.  
(1)
 LEdHN[7A] [7A]Hardison and the EEOC insist that the statutory obligation to accommodate religious needs takes precedence over both the collective-bargaining contract and the seniority rights of TWA's other employees.  We agree that neither a collective-bargaining contract nor a seniority system may be employed to violate the statute, 1Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S., at 778Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36 (1974)2  but we do not believe that the duty to accommodate requires TWA to take steps inconsistent with the otherwise valid agreement.  Collective bargaining, aimed at effecting workable and enforceable agreements between management and labor, lies at the core of our national labor policy, and seniority provisions are universally included in these contracts.  Without a clear and express indication from Congress, we cannot agree with Hardison and the EEOC that an agreed-upon seniority system must give way when necessary to accommodate religious observances. The issue is important and warrants some discussion.  
 [****29]  [*80]   Any employer who, like TWA, conducts an around-the-clock operation is presented with the choice of allocating work schedules either in accordance with the preferences of its employees or by involuntary assignment.  Insofar as the varying shift preferences of its employees complement each other, TWA could meet its manpower needs through voluntary work scheduling.  In the present case, for example, Hardison's supervisor  [**2275]  foresaw little difficulty in giving Hardison his religious holidays off since they fell on days that most other employees preferred to work, while Hardison was willing to work on the traditional holidays that most other employees preferred to have off.  
Whenever there are not enough employees who choose to work a particular shift, however, some employees must be assigned to that shift even though it is not their first choice.  Such was evidently the case with regard to Saturday work; even though TWA cut back its weekend work force to a skeleton crew, not enough employees chose those days off to staff the Stores Department through voluntary scheduling.  In these circumstances, TWA and IAM agreed to give first preference to employees who had [****30]  worked in a particular department the longest.  
Had TWA nevertheless circumvented the seniority system by relieving Hardison of Saturday work and ordering a senior employee to  [***129]  replace him, it would have denied the latter his shift preference so that Hardison could be given his.  The senior employee would also have been deprived of his contractual rights under the collective-bargaining agreement.  
It was essential to TWA's business to require Saturday and Sunday work from at least a few employees even though most employees preferred those days off.  Allocating the burdens of weekend work was a matter for collective bargaining.  In considering criteria to govern this allocation, TWA and the union had two alternatives: adopt a neutral system, such as seniority, a lottery, or rotating shifts; or allocate days off in  [*81]  accordance with the religious needs of its employees.  TWA would have had to adopt the latter in order to assure Hardison and others like him of getting the days off necessary for strict observance of their religion, but it could have done so only at the expense of others who had strong, but perhaps nonreligious, reasons for not working on weekends.  [****31]  There were no volunteers to relieve Hardison on Saturdays, and to give Hardison Saturdays off, TWA would have had to deprive another employee of his shift preference at least in part because he did not adhere to a religion that observed the Saturday Sabbath.  
 LEdHN[8] [8]Title VII does not contemplate such unequal treatment. The repeated, unequivocal emphasis of both the language and the legislative history of Title VII is on eliminating discrimination in employment, and such discrimination is proscribed when it is directed against majorities as well as minorities.  See supra, at 71-72.  Indeed, the foundation of Hardison's claim is that TWA and IAM engaged in religious discrimination in violation of 703(a)(1) when they failed to arrange for him to have Saturdays off.  I would be anomalous to conclude that by &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; Congress meant that an employer must deny the shift and job preference of some employees, as well as deprive them of their contractual rights, in order to accommodate or prefer the religious needs of others, and we conclude that Title VII does not require an employer to go that far. 
 [****32]  (2)
 LEdHN[9] [9] LEdHN[10] [10]Our conclusion is supported by the fact that seniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII itself.  Section 703(h) provides in pertinent part: S
&quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment  [*82]  pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system… provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin….&quot; 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-2(h).I 

&quot;[T]he unmistakable purpose of § 703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under Title VII.&quot; Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 352 (1977). See also United  [**2276]  Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,  [***130]  431 U.S. 553 (1977). [****33]  Section 703(h) is &quot;a definitional provision; as with the other provisions of § 703, subsection (h) delineates which employment practices are illegal and thereby prohibited and which are not.&quot; Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 758 (1976). Thus, absent a discriminatory purpose, the operation of a seniority system cannot be an unlawful employment practice even if the system has some discriminatory consequences.  
 LEdHN[11A] [11A]There has been no suggestion of discriminatory intent in this case.  &quot;The seniority system was not designed with the intention to discriminate against religion nor did it act to lock members of any religion into a pattern wherein their freedom to exercise their religion was limited.  It was coincidental that in plaintiff's case the seniority system acted to compound his problems in exercising his religion.&quot; 375 F.Supp., at 883. The Court of Appeals' conclusion that TWA was not limited by the terms of its seniority system was in substance nothing more than [****34]  a ruling that operation of the seniority system was itself an unlawful employment practice even though no discriminatory purpose had been shown.  That ruling is plainly inconsistent with the dictates of § 703(h), both on its face and as interpreted in the recent decisions of this Court.  1LEdHN[11B]
424 U.S., at 762United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558-560 (1977)3 
 [****35]  [*83]     LEdHN[7B] [7B] LEdHN[12A] [12A]As we have said, TWA was not required by Title VII to carve out a special exception to its seniority system in order to help Hardison to meet his religious obligations.  1LEdHN[12B]
375 F.Supp., at 884Id., 71375 F.Supp., at 8914  
 [****36]  [*84]    C 
 [***131]   LEdHN[5C] [5C]The Court of Appeals also suggested that TWA could have permitted Hardison to work a four-day week if necessary in order to avoid working on his Sabbath.  Recognizing  [**2277]  that this might have left TWA short-handed on the one shift each week that Hardison did not work, the court still concluded that TWA would suffer no undue hardship if it were required to replace Hardison either with supervisory personnel or with qualified personnel from other departments.  Alternatively, the Court of Appeals suggested that TWA could have replaced Hardison on his Saturday shift with other available employees through the payment of premium wages.  Both of these alternatives would involve costs to TWA, either in the form of lost efficiency in other jobs or higher wages.  
 LEdHN[13] [13]To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give Hardison Saturdays off is an undue hardship. 1375 F.Supp., at 8915  Like abandonment of the seniority system, to require TWA to bear additional costs when no such costs are incurred [****37]  to give other employees the days off that they want would involve unequal treatment of employees on the basis of their religion. By suggesting that TWA should incur certain costs in order to give Hardison Saturdays off the Court of Appeals would in effect require TWA to finance an additional Saturday off and then to choose the employee who will enjoy it on the basis of his religious beliefs.  While incurring extra costs to secure a replacement for Hardison might remove the necessity of compelling another employee to work involuntarily  [*85]  in Hardison's place, it would not change the fact that the privilege of having Saturdays off would be allocated according to religious beliefs.  
 [****38]   LEdHN[14] [14]As we have seen, the paramount concern of Congress in enacting Title VII was the elimination of discrimination in employment.  In the absence of clear statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, we will not readily construe the statute to require an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their  [***132]  Sabbath.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.  
One of the most intractable problems arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e et seq., has been whether an employer is guilty of religious discrimination when he discharges an employee (or refuses to hire a job applicant) because of the employee's religious practices.  Particularly troublesome has been the plight of adherents to minority faiths who do not observe the holy days on which most businesses are closed -- Sundays, Christmas, and Easter - but who need time off for their own days of religious observance. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has [****39]  grappled with this problem in two sets of regulations, and in a long line of decisions.  Initially the Commission concluded that an employer was &quot;free under Title VII to establish a normal workweek… generally applicable to all employees,&quot; and that an employee could not &quot;demand any alteration in [his work schedule] to accommodate his religious needs.&quot; 29 CFR §§ 1605.1 (a)(3), (b)(3) (1967).  Eventually, however, the Commission changed its view and decided that employers must reasonably accommodate such requested schedule changes except where &quot;undue hardship&quot; would result -- for example, &quot;where the employee's needed work cannot be performed  [*86]  by another employee of substantially similar qualifications during the period of absence.&quot; 29 CFR § 1605.1 (b) (1976).  1§ 1605.1Section 1605.1
*  In  [**2278]  amending Title VII in 1972 Congress confronted the same problem, and adopted the second position of the EEOC.  Pub. L. 92-261, § 2(7), 86 Stat. 103, codified at 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e (j) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Both before and after the 1972 amendment the lower courts have considered at length the circumstances in which employers [****40]  must accommodate the religious practices of employees, reaching what the Court correctly describes as conflicting results, ante, at 75 n. 10.  And on two occasions this Court has attempted to provide guidance to the lower courts, only to find ourselves evenly divided.  Parker Seal Co. v. Cummins, 429 U.S. 65 (1976); Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 402 U.S. 689 (1971).
Today's decision deals a fatal blow to all efforts under Title VII to accommodate work requirements to religious practices.  The Court holds, in essence, that although the EEOC  [***133]  regulations and the Act state that an employer must make reasonable adjustments in his work demands to take account of religious observances, the regulation and Act do not  [*87]  really mean what they say.  An employer, the Court concludes, need not grant even the most minor special privilege to religious observers to enable them to follow their faith.  As a question of social policy, this result is deeply troubling, for a society that truly values religious pluralism cannot compel adherents of minority religions to make the cruel choice of surrendering their religion or their job.And as a matter of law [****41]  today's result is intolerable, for the Court adopts the very position that Congress expressly rejected in 1972, as if we were free to disregard congressional choices that a majority of this Court thinks unwise.  I therefore dissent.  
 [****42]  I 
With respect to each of the proposed accommodations to respondent Hardison's religious observances that the Court discusses, it ultimately notes that the accommodation would have required &quot;unequal treatment,&quot; ante, at 81, 84-85, in favor of the religious observer. That is quite true.  But if an accommodation can be rejected simply because it involves preferential treatment, then the regulation and the statute, while brimming with &quot;sound and fury,&quot; ultimately &quot;signif[y] nothing.&quot; 
The accommodation issue by definition arises only when a neutral rule of general applicability conflicts with the religious practices of a particular employee.  In some of the reported cases, the rule in question has governed work attire; in other cases it has required attendance at some religious function; in still other instances, it has compelled membership in a union; and in the largest class of cases, it has concerned work schedules.  222 ALR Fed. 580 (1975)  What all these cases have in common is an employee who could comply with the rule only by violating what the employee views as a religious commandment.  In each  [*88]  instance, the question is whether the employee is to be exempt from the rule's demands.  [****43]  To do so will always result in a privilege being &quot;allocated according to religious beliefs,&quot; ante, at 85, unless  [**2279]  the employer gratuitously decides to repeal the rule in toto. What the statute says, in plain words, is that such allocations are required unless &quot;undue hardship&quot; would result.  
The point is perhaps best made by considering a not altogether hypothetical example.  See CCH EEOC Decisions (1973) P 6180. Assume that an employer requires all employees to wear a particular type of hat at work in order to make the employees readily identifiable to customers.  Such a rule obviously does not, on its face, violate Title VII, and an employee who altered the uniform for reasons of teste could be discharged.  But a very different [****44]  question would be posed by the discharge of an employee who, for religious reasons, insisted on wearing over her hair a tightly fitted scarf  [***134]  which was visible through the hat.  In such a case the employer could accommodate this religious practice without undue hardship -- or any hardship at all.  Yet as I understand the Court's analysis -- and nothing in the Court's response, ante, at 83 n. 14, 84 n. 15, is to the contrary - the accommodation would not be required because it would afford the privilege of wearing scarfs to a select few based on their religious beliefs.  The employee thus would have to give up either the religious practice or the job.  This, I submit, makes a mockery of the statute.  
In reaching this result, the Court seems almost oblivious of the legislative history of the 1972 amendments to Title VII which is briefly recounted in the Court's opinion, ante, at 73-75.  That history is far more instructive than the Court allows.  After the EEOC promulgated its second set of guidelines requiring reasonable accommodations unless undue hardship would result, at least two courts issued decisions questioning, whether the guidelines were consistent with Title [****45]  VII.  Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F.2d 324 (CA6 1970),  [*89]  aff'd by equally divided Court, 402 U.S. 689 (1971); Riley v. Bendix Corp., 330 F.Supp. 583 (MD Fla. 1971), rev'd, 464 F.2d 1113 (CA5 1972). These courts reasoned, in language strikingly similar to today's decision, that to excuse religious observers from neutral work rules would &quot;discriminate against… other employees&quot; and &quot;constitute unequal administration of the collective-bargaining agreement.&quot; Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., supra, at 330. They therefore refused to equate &quot;religious discrimination with failure to accommodate.&quot; 429 F.2d at 335. When Congress was reviewing Title VII in 1972, Senator Jennings Randolph informed the Congress of these decisions which, he said, had &quot;clouded&quot; the meaning of religious discrimination. 118 Cong. Rec. 706 (1972).  He introduced an amendment, tracking the language of the EEOC regulation, to make clear that Title VII requires religious accommodation, even though unequal treatment would result.  The primary purpose of the amendment, he explained, was to protect Saturday Sabbatarians like [****46]  himself from employers who refuse &quot;to hire or to continue in employment employees whose religious practices rigidly require them to abstain from work in the nature of hire on particular days.&quot; Id., at 705.  His amendment was unaminously approved by the Senate on a roll-call vote, id., at 731, and was accepted by the Conference Committee, H.R. Rep. No. 92-899, p. 15 (1972); S. Rep. No. 92-681, p. 15 (1972), whose report was approved by both Houses, 118 Cong. Rec. 7169, 7573 (1972).  Yet the Court today, in rejecting any accommodation that involves preferential treatment, follows the Dewey decision in direct contravention of congressional intent.  
The Court's interpretation of the statute, by effectively nullifying it, has the singluar advantage of making consideration of petitioner's constitutional challenge unnecessary.  The Court does not even rationalize its construction on this ground, however, nor could it, since &quot;resort to an alternative construction to avoid deciding a constitutional question is appropriate  [*90]  only when such a course is 'fairly possible' or when the statute  [***135]  provides a 'fair alternative' construction.&quot; Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 378 n. 11  [**2280]  (1977). [****47]  Moreover, while important constitutional questions would be posed by interpreting the law to compel employers (or fellow employees) to incur substantial costs to aid the religious observer, 3  not all accommodations are costly, and the constitutionality of the statute is not placed in serious doubt simply because it sometimes requires an exemption from a work rule.  Indeed, this Court has repeatedly found no Establishment Clause problems in exempting religious observers from state-imposed duties, e.g., Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 234-235, n. 22 (1972); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 409 (1963); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), even when the exemption was in no way compelled by the Free Exercise Clause, e.g., Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437 (1971); Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 371-372 (1970) (WHITE, J., dissenting); Sherbert v. Verner, supra, at 422 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 608 (1961) (dictum); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 520 (1961) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  4Young v. Southwestern Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 509 F.2d 140 (CA5 1975)United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 176 (1965)Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971)Establishment ClauseWalz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 668 (1970)  If the State does not establish  [****48]   [*91]  religion over nonreligion by excusing religious practitioners from obligations owed the State, I do not see how the State can be said to establish religion by requiring employers to do the same with respect to obligations owed the employer.  Thus, I think it beyond dispute that the Act does -- and, consistently with the First Amendment, can -- require employers to grant privileges to religious observers as part of the accommodation process.  
 [****49]  II 
Once it is determined that the duty to accommodate sometimes requires that an employee be exempted from an otherwise valid work requirement, the only remaining question is whether this is such  [***136]  a case: Did TWA prove that it exhausted all reasonable accommodations, and that the only remaining alternatives would have caused undue hardship on TWA's business? To pose the question is to answer it, for all that the District Court found TWA had done to accommodate respondent's Sabbath observance was that it &quot;held several meetings with [respondent]… [and] authorized the union steward to search for someone who would swap shifts.&quot; 375 F.Supp. 877, 890-891 (WD Mo. 1974). To conclude that TWA, one of the largest air carriers in the Nation, would have suffered undue hardship had it done anything more defies both reason and common sense.  
The Court implicitly assumes that the only means of accommodation open to TWA were to compel an unwilling employee to replace Hardison; to pay premium wages to  [**2281]  a voluntary substitute; or to employ one less person during  [*92]  respondent's Sabbath shift.  5  Based on this assumption, the Court seemingly finds [****50]  that each alternative would have involved undue hardship not only because Hardison would have been given a special privilege, but also because either another employee would have been deprived of rights under the collective-bargaining agreement, ante, at 80-81, or because &quot;more than a de minimis cost,&quot; ante, at 84, would have been imposed on TWA.  But the Court's myopic view of the available options is not supported by either the District Court's findings or the evidence adduced at trial.  Thus, the Court's conclusion cannot withstand analysis, even assuming that its rejection of the alternatives it does discuss is justifiable.  6375 F.Supp., at 891
supra, at 85-86  
 [****51]  [*93]    To  [***137]  begin with, the record simply does not support the Court's assertion, made without accompanying citations, that &quot;[t]here were no volunteers to relieve Hardison on Saturdays,&quot; ante, at 81.  Everett Kussman, the manager of the department in which respondent worked, testified that he had made no effort to find volunteers, App. 136, 7  and the union stipulated that its steward had not done so either, id., at 158.  88 The Court relies, ante, at 78, on the District Court's conclusory assertion that &quot;[a]ny shift or change was impossible within the seniority framework.&quot; 375 F.Supp., at 889. But the District Court also found that &quot;TWA did not take part in the search for employees willing to swap shifts… and it was admitted at trial that the Union made no real effort.&quot; Id., at 888. Thus, the District Court's statement concerning the impact of &quot;the seniority framework&quot; lends no support to the Court's assertion that there were no volunteers.  See also n. 10, infra.    [**2282]  Thus, contrary to the Court's assumption, there may have been one or more employees who, for reasons of either sympathy or personal convenience, willingly would have substituted  [*94]  for respondent on Saturdays until respondent could either regain the non-Saturday shift he had held for the three preceding months 9  or transfer back to his old department where he had sufficient seniority to avoid Saturday work.  Alternatively, there may have been an employee who preferred respondent's Thursday-Monday daytime shift to his own; in fact, respondent testified that he had informed Kussman and the union steward that the clerk on the Sunday-Thursday night shift (the &quot;graveyard&quot; shift) was dissatisfied with his hours.  Id., at 70.  Thus,  [****52]  respondent's religious observance might have been accommodated by a simple trade of days or shifts without necessarily depriving any employee of his or her contractual rights 1375 F.Supp., at 884
id., at 1440  and without  [*95]  imposing significant  [***138]  costs on TWA.  Of course, it is also possible that no trade -- or none consistent with the seniority system - could have been arranged. But the burden under the EEOC regulation is on TWA to establish that a reasonable accommodation was not possible.  29 CFR § 1605.1(c)(1976).Because it failed either to explore the possibility of a voluntary trade or to assure that its delegate, the union steward, did so, TWA was unable to meet its burden.  
 [****53]  Nor was a voluntary trade the only option open to TWA that the Court ignores; to the contrary, at least two other options are apparent from the record.  First, TWA could have paid overtime to a voluntary replacement for respondent -- assuming that someone would have been willing to work Saturdays for premium pay -- and passed on the cost to respondent.  In fact, one accommodation Hardison suggested would have done just that by requiring Hardison to work overtime when needed at regular pay.  Under this plan, the total overtime cost to the employer -- and the total number of overtime hours available for other employees -- would not have reflected Hardison's Sabbath absences.  Alternatively, TWA could have transferred respondent back to his previous department where he had accumulated substantial seniority, as respondent also suggested.  11  Admittedly, both options would have violated the collective-bargaining agreement; the former because the agreement required that employees working over 40 hours per week receive premium pay, and the latter because the agreement prohibited employees from transferring  [*96]  departments  [**2283]  more than once every six months.  But neither [****54]  accommodation would have deprived any other employee of rights under the contract or violated the seniority system in any way.  1Draper v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., 527 F.2d 515 (CA6 1975)2  Plainly an employer cannot avoid his duty to accommodate by signing a contract that precludes all reasonable accommodations; even the Court appears to concede as much, ante, at 79.  Thus I do not believe it can be even seriously argued that TWA would have suffered &quot;undue hardship&quot; to its business had it required respondent to pay the extra costs of his replacement, or had it transferred respondent to his former department.  1Establishment Clausesupra, at 90Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 389-390 (1918)Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Market, 366 U.S. 617, 627 (1961)3  
 [****55]  What  [***139]  makes today's decision most tragic, however, is not that respondent Hardison has been needlessly deprived of his livelihood simply because he chose to follow the dictates of his conscience.  Nor is the tragedy exhausted by the impact it will have on thousands of Americans like Hardison who could be forced to live on welfare as the price they must pay for  [*97]  worshiping their God.  1Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963)4  The ultimate tragedy is that despite Congress' best efforts, one of this Nation's pillars of strength -- our hospitality to religious diversity -- has been seriously eroded.  All Americans will be a little poorer until today's decision is erased.  
 [****56]  I respectfully dissent.

1 The TWA-IAM agreement provides in pertinent part: &quot;The principle of seniority shall apply in the application of this Agreement in all reductions or increases of force, preference of shift assignment, vacation period selection, in bidding for vacancies or new jobs, and in all promotions, demotions, or transfers involving classifications covered by this Agreement.  .  .  .&quot;Except as hereafter provided in this paragraph, seniority shall apply in selection of shifts and days off within a classification within a department….&quot; App. 214.  
2 TWA is the petitioner in No. 75-1126.  Petitioners in No. 75-1385 are the international, local, and district levels of IAM, hereinafter collectively referred to as IAM or the union.
3 The union did have a Relief Committee organized to deal with the emergency problems of its members.  The record reveals that in the past this Committee had been instrumental in arranging for temporary adjustments in work schedules to meet the needs of union members; but the record also reveals that the Relief Committee had almost never arranged permanent changes in work assignments and that Hardison never sought the assistance of that Committee.
4 The District Court voiced concern that if it did not find an undue hardship in such circumstances, accommodation of religious observances might impose &quot;'a priority of the religious over the secular'&quot; and thereby raise significant questions as to the constitutional validity of the statute under the .  , quoting Edwards &amp; Kaplan, Religious Discrimination and the Role of Arbitration Under Title VII, 69 Mich. L. Rev. 599, 628 (1971).
5 Because the judgment in its favor was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the union was a prevailing party below; and Hardison has not filed a petition for certiorari seeking to change that judgment.  It may thus appear anomalous to have granted the union's petition for certiorari as well as that of TWA.  But the union's view is that the judgment below against TWA seriously involves union interests, because the rationale of the Court of Appeals' opinion, as the union understands it, &quot;necessarily and explicitly assumes that petitioner Unions are legally obligated to waive or vary provisions of their collective bargaining agreement in order to accommodate respondent Hardison's beliefs, if called upon by TWA to do so.&quot; Pet. for Cert. in No. 75-1385, p. 2.  This would appear to be the position of Hardison and the EEOC in this Court.  Since we reverse the judgment against TWA, we need not pursue further the union's status in this Court.
6 See ; ; ; . From the outset, Congress has said that &quot;[t]he purpose of [Title VII] is to eliminate, through the utilization of formal and informal remedial procedures, discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, or national origin.&quot; H.R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1963).  See 110 Cong. Rec. 13079-13080 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Clark).  When Congress amended Title VII in 1972, it did not waver from its principal goal.  While Congressmen differed on the best methods to eliminate discrimination in employment, no one questioned the desirability of seeking that goal.  Compare H.R. Rep. No. 92-238 (1971) (majority report of the Committee of the Whole House), with  (minority report).
7 The EEOC expressed the view that &quot;undue hardship, for example, may exist where the employee's needed work cannot be performed by another employee of substantially similar qualifications during the period of absence of the Sabbath observer,&quot; .  This single example was by no means intended to be exhaustive.  In substance, the EEOC left further definition of its guidelines to its review of &quot;each case on an individual basis in an effort to seek an equitable application of these guidelines to the variety of situations which arise due to the varied religious practices of the American people.&quot; Ibid. The EEOC at that time did not purport to change the view expressed in its 1966 guidelines that work schedules generally applicable to all employees may not be unreasonable, even if they do not &quot;operate with uniformity… upon the religious observances of [all] employees.&quot; The EEOC's present view, expressed in an amicus curiae brief filed in support of Hardison and the Court of Appeals' judgment, is now otherwise, at least to some extent.
8   [2B]Judgment entered by an equally divided Court is not &quot;entitled to precedential weight,&quot; . Our ruling in Dewey thus does not resolve the questions there presented.  Other factors, as well, make the impact of Dewey inconclusive.  The conduct alleged to be an unlawful employment practice occurred prior to the promulgation of the 1967 guidelines, and the Court of Appeals expressed the view that those guidelines should not be given retroactive effect.  Also, an earlier ruling by an arbitrator was held to have conclusively resolved the religious discrimination question in favor of the employer.  But see . Finally, the employer in Dewey was not excused from a duty to accommodate; the Court of Appeals simply held that the employer had satisfied any obligation that it might have had under the statute.
9 Section 701(j) was added to the 1972 amendments on the floor of the Senate.  The legislative history of the measure consists chiefly of a brief floor debate in the Senate, contained in less than two pages of the Congressional Record and consisting principally of the views of the proponent of the measure, Senator Jennings Randolph.  118 Cong. Rec. 705-706 (1972).  The Congressional Record, 118 Cong. Rec. 706-713 (1972), also contains reprints of , rev'd, , as well as a brief synopsis of the new provision, which makes reference to Dewey, 118 Cong. Rec. 7167 (1972).  The significance of the legislative references to prior case law is unclear.  In Riley the District Court ruled that an employer who discharged an employee for refusing to work on his Sabbath had not committed an unfair labor practice even though the employer had not made any effort whatsoever to accommodate the employee's religious needs.  It is clear from the language of § 701(j) that Congress intended to change this result by requiring some form of accommodation; but this tells us nothing about how much an employer must do to satisfy its statutory obligation.  The reference to Dewey is even more opaque: &quot;The purpose of this subsection is to provide the statutory basis for EEOC to formulate guidelines on discrimination because of religion such as those challenged in Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Company, 429 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1970), Affirmed by an equally divided court, .&quot; 118 Cong. Rec. 7167 (1972).  Clearly, any suggestion in Dewey that an employer may not be required to make reasonable accommodation for the religious needs of its employees was disapproved by § 701(j); but Congress did not indicate that &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; requires an employer to do more than was done in Dewey, apparently preferring to leave that question open for future resolution by the EEOC.  See also n.8, supra. 
10 Cases decided by the Courts of Appeals since the enactment of the 1972 amendments to Title VII similarly provide us with little guidance as to the scope of the employer's obligation.  In circumstances where an employer has declined to take steps that would burden some employees in order to permit another employee or prospective employee to observe his Sabbath, the Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits have found no violation for failure to accommodate. ; , cert. denied, 429 U.S. 964 (1976), pet. for rehearing pending, No. 75-1105; . But the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have also reached the opposite conclusion on similar facts.  ; , aff'd by equally divided ; . These apparent intra-Circuit conflicts may be explainable on the basis of the differing facts of each case, but neither the Fifth nor the Sixth Circuit has suggested a theory of decision to justify the differing results that have been reached.
11  [****24]    [4B]Ordinarily, an EEOC guideline is not entitled to great weight where, as here, it varies from prior EEOC policy and no new legislative history has been introduced in support of the change.  . But where &quot;Congress has not just kept its silence by refusing to overturn the administrative construction, but has ratified it with positive legislation,&quot;  (footnote omitted), the guideline is entitled to some deference, at least sufficient in this case to warrant our accepting the guideline as a defensible construction of the pre-1972 statute, i.e., as imposing on TWA the duty of &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; in the absence of &quot;undue hardship.&quot; We thus need not consider whether § 701 (j) must be applied retroactively to the facts of this litigation.
12 &quot;This Court has long held that employee expectations arising from a seniority system agreement may be modified by statutes furthering a strong public policy interest.&quot; . Cf.  . In Franks we held that it was permissible to award retroactive seniority to victims of past discrimination in order to implement the strong congressional policy of making victims of discrimination whole.  Franks is not dispositive of the present case since here there is no evidence of past discrimination that must be remedied.  Not only is the &quot;make-whole&quot; policy not present in this case, but, as we shall see, the strong congressional policy against discrimination in employment argues against interpreting the statute to require the abrogation of the seniority rights of some employees in order to accommodate the religious needs of others.
13   [11B]Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., is not to the contrary.  In Franks we held that &quot;once an illegal discriminatory practice occurring after the effective date of the Act is proved,&quot; , § 703(h) does not bar an award of retroactive seniority status to victims of that discriminatory practice.  Here the suggested exception to the TWA-IAM seniority system would not be remedial; the operation of the seniority system itself is said to violate Title VII. In such circumstances, § 703(h) unequivocally mandates that there is no statutory violation in the absence of a showing of discriminatory purpose.  See .
14   [12B]Despite its hyperbole and rhetoric, the dissent appears to agree with -- at least it stops short of challenging -- the fundamental proposition that Title VII does not require an employer and a union who have agreed on a seniority system to deprive senior employees of their seniority rights in order to accommodate a junior employee's religious practices.  This is the principal issue on which TWA and the union came to this Court.  The dissent is thus reduced to (1) asserting that the statute requires TWA to accommodate Hardison even though substantial expenditures are required to do so; and (2) advancing its own view of the record to show that TWA could have done more than it did to accommodate Hardison without violating the seniority system or incurring substantial additional costs.we reject the former assertion as an erroneous construction of the statute.  As for the latter, we prefer the findings of the District Judge who heard the evidence.  Thus, the dissent suggests that through further efforts TWA or the union might have arranged a temporary or permanent job swap within the seniority system, despite the District Court's express finding, supported by the record, that &quot;[t]he seniority provisions… precluded the possibility of plaintiff's changing his shift.&quot; . Similarly, the dissent offers two alternatives -- sending Hardison back to Building 1 or allowing him to work extra days without overtime pay -- that it says could have been pursued by TWA or the union, even though neither of the courts below even hinted that these suggested alternatives would have been feasible under the circumstances.  Furthermore, Buildings 1 and 2 had separate seniority lists, and insofar as the record shows, a return to Building 1 would not have solved Hardison's problems.  Hardison himself testified that he &quot;gave up&quot; his Building 1 seniority when he came to Building 2, App. 104, and that the union would not accept his early return to Building 1 in part &quot;because the problem of seniority came up again.&quot; .  We accept the District Court's findings that TWA had done all that it could do to accommodate Hardison's religious beliefs without either incurring substantial costs or violating the seniority rights of other employees.  See .
15 The dissent argues that &quot;the costs to TWA of either paying overtime or not replacing respondent would [not] have been more than de minimis.&quot; Post, at 92 n. 6.  This ignores, however, the express finding of the District Court that &quot;[b]oth of these solutions would have created an undue burden on the conduct of TWA's business,&quot; , and it fails to take account of the likelihood that a company as large as TWA may have many employees whose religious observances, like Hardison's, prohibit them from working on Saturdays or Sundays.
1 The Court's statement that in promulgating the second guidelines &quot;[t]he EEOC… did not purport to change the view expressed in its 1966 guidelines that work schedules generally applicable to all employees may not be unreasonable,&quot; ante, at 72 n. 7, is incomprehensible.  The preface to the later guidelines, 32 Fed. Reg. 10298 (1967), states that the &quot;Commission hereby amends , Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion….   as amended shall read as follows….&quot; Thus the later guidelines expressly repealed the earlier guidelines. Moreover, the example of &quot;undue hardship&quot; given in the new guidelines and quoted in the text makes clear that the Commission believed, contrary to its earlier view, that in certain instances employers would be required to excuse employees from work for religious observances. In its decisions subsequent to the formulation of the guidelines, the Commission has consistently held that employers must accommodate Sabbath observances where substitute employees are available.  Compare CCH EEOC Decisions (1973) PP 6060, 6154, with, e.g., PP 6120, 6310, 6367.
2 Many of the cases are collected in Annot., . For a perceptive discussion of the issues posed by the cases see Note, Accommodation of an Employee's Religious Practices Under Title VII, 1976 U. Ill. L. Forum 867.
3 Because of the view I take of the facts, see Part II, infra, I find it unnecessary to decide how much cost an employer must bear before he incurs &quot;undue hardship.&quot; I also leave for another day the merits of any constitutional objections that could be raised if the law were construed to require employers (or employees) to assume significant costs in accommodating.  
4 The exemption here, like those we have upheld, can be claimed by any religious practitioner, a term that the EEOC has sensibly defined to include atheists, e.g., CCH EEOC Decisions (1973) P 6316, see also , and persons not belonging to any organized sect but who hold &quot;'[a] sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption,'&quot; CCH Employment Practices P 6500, quoting . The purpose and primary effect of requiring such exemptions is the wholly secular one of securing equal economic opportunity to members of minority religions. Cf., e.g., . And the mere fact that the law sometimes requires special treatment of religious practitioners does not present the dangers of &quot;sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,&quot; against which the  is principally aimed, .
5 It is true that these are the only options the Court of Appeals discussed.  But that court found that TWA could have adopted these options without undue hardship; once that conclusion is rejected it is incumbent on this Court to decide whether any other alternatives were available that would not have involved such hardship.  
6 I entertain grave doubts on both factual and legal grounds about the validity of the Court's rejection of the options it considers.  As a matter of fact, I do not believe the record supports the Court's suggestion that the costs to TWA of either paying overtime or not replacing respondent would have been more than de minimis. While the District Court did state, as the Court notes, ante, at 84 n. 15, that both alternatives &quot;would have created an undue burden on the conduct of TWA's business,&quot; , the court did not explain its understanding of the phrase &quot;undue burden,&quot; and may have believed that such a burden exists whenever any cost is incurred by the employer, no matter how slight.  Thus the District Court's assertion falls far short of a factual &quot;finding&quot; that the costs of these accommodations would be more than de minimis. Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence documenting the extent of the &quot;efficiency loss&quot; TWA would have incurred had it used a supervisor or an already scheduled employee to do respondent's work, and while the stipulations make clear what overtime would have cost, the price is far from staggering: $ 150 for three months, at which time respondent would have been eligible to transfer back to his previous department.  The Court's suggestion that the cost of accommodation must be evaluated in light of the &quot;likelihood that… TWA may have many employees whose religious observances… prohibit them from working on Saturdays or Sundays,&quot; ante at 84 n. 15, is not only contrary to the record, which indicates that only one other case involving a conflict between work schedules and Sabbath observance had arisen at TWA since 1945, Tr. 312-314, but also irrelevant, since the real question is not whether such employees exist but whether they could be accommodated without significant expense.  Indeed, to the extent that TWA employed Sunday as well as Saturday Sabbatarians, the likelihood of accommodation being costly would diminish, since trades would be more feasible.  As a matter of law, I seriously question whether simple English usage permits &quot;undue hardship&quot; to be interpreted to mean &quot;more than de minimis cost,&quot; especially when the examples the guidelines give of possible undue hardship is the absence of a qualified substitute, .  I therefore believe that in the appropriate case we would be compelled to confront the constitutionality of requiring employers to bear more than de minimis costs.  The issue need not be faced here, however, since an almost cost-free accommodation was possible.
7 Wilbur Stone, Director of Industrial Relations, Technical Service, at TWA confirmed Kussman's testimony.  App. 157-158.  In its Response to Plaintiff's Suggested Findings of Fact, TWA conceded that it &quot;did not attempt to find a replacement for plaintiff.&quot; App. in No. 74-1424 (CA6), p. 191, P3(1).  
9 Respondent lost the non-Sabbath shift when an employee junior to him went on vacation.  The vacation was to last only two weeks, however, and the record does not explain why respondent did not regain his shift at the end of that time.  
10 If, as appears likely, no one senior to the substitute employee desired respondent's Sabbath assignment or his Thursday-Monday shift, then the substitute could have transferred to respondent's position without depriving anyone of his or her seniority expectations.  Similarly, if, as also appears probable, no one senior to respondent desired the substitute's spot, respondent could have assumed it.  Such a trade would not have deprived any employee of seniority expectations.  The trade apparently still would have violated the collective-bargaining agreement, however, since the agreement authorized transfers only to vacant jobs.  This is undoubtedly what the District Court meant when it found that &quot;the seniority framework&quot; precluded shift changes.  sSee n. 8, supra. Indeed, the first time in the District Court's opinion that such a finding appears, it is preceded by the finding that &quot;there were no jobs open for bid.&quot; . Even if a trade could not have been arranged without disrupting seniority expectations TWA could have requested the Union Relief Committee to approve an exemption. The record reveals that the Committee's function was to ameliorate the rigidity of the system, App. 130, and that on at least one occasion it had approved a permanent transfer apparently outside the seniority system, .
11 The Court states, ante, at 83 n. 14, that because of TWA's departmental seniority system, such a transfer &quot;would not have solved Hardison's problems.&quot; But respondent testified without contradiction that had he returned to his previous department he would have regained his seniority in that department, and thereby could have avoided work on his Sabbath. App. 70-71.  According to respondent, the only objection that was raised to this solution was that it violated the rule prohibiting transfers twice within six months.  Ibid.
12 The accommodations would have disadvantaged respondent to some extent, but since he suggested both options I do not consider whether an employer would satisfy his duty to accommodate by offering these choices to an unwilling employee.  Cf.   (employer does not discharge his duty to accommodate by offering to transfer an electrician to an unskilled position).  
13 Of course, the accommodations discussed in the text would have imposed some administrative inconvenience on TWA.  Petitioners do not seriously argue, however, that this consequence of accommodation makes the statute violative of the .  Were such an argument to be made, our prior decision upholding exemptions from state-created duties, see , would provide a complete answer, since the exemptions we have sustained have placed not inconsiderable burdens on private parties.  For example, the effect of excusing conscientious objectors from military conscription is to require a nonobjector to serve instead, yet we have repeatedly upheld this exemption. E.g., . See also  (upholding law prohibiting private citizens from engaging in specified activities within a fixed distance from places of public worship).
14 Ironically, the fiscal costs to society of today's decision may exceed the costs that would accrue if employers were required to make all accommodations without regard to hardship, since it is clear that persons on welfare cannot be denied benefits because they refuse to take jobs that would prevent them from observing religious holy days, see .</Comments>

            <Text>Capital Boost Likely Failed To Reasonably Accommodate Barat’s Religious Practices In Its Offer. However, it is more likely than not that Barat’s Failure to Engage in the Bilateral Negotiation Process Undermines His Claim.
	Within the 10th circuit, a reasonable accommodation is an ad hoc determination. The facts of the case are evaluated to determine if the accommodation offered allows the employee to practice their religious practices despite the normal rules of the employer Tabura v. Kellogg USA, 880 F.3d 544, 550 (10th Cir. 2018). 
This subsection evaluates whether Capital Boost shifted the burden after Barat established a prima facie case, and, on the premise that it did, whether Barat then met his obligation to propose an alternate accommodations.

            <Text>Umbrella:
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers must reasonably accommodate an employee’s sincerely held religious beliefs or practices unless doing so would impose an “undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977) has been the most controlling case over this, which allowed employers to deny accommodations that imposed “more than a de minimis cost.” Id. at 84. This low threshold favored employers and made the proving of an undue hardship straight-forward. However, with Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), the Supreme Court clarified from Hardison’s “de minimis” standard, stating instead that Title VII requires that: “An employer must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.” Id. at 460. This increased standard demands a more in-depth, fact-based inquiry into the actual impact of accommodation, rather than more-than-minor costs. A “reasonable accommodation” under Title VII is one that effectively resolves the conflict between an employee’s religious practice and workplace requirements, even if it is not the employee’s preferred solution. Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 70 (1986). The employer meets its obligation if the offered accommodation allows the employee to practice their religion without requiring the employer to bear a substantial burden.
The sections that follow address two issues: first, whether Capital Boost provided reasonable accommodation and whether Barat adequately engaged in that process; additionally, whether Capital Boost can establish undue hardship based on operational disruptions and coworker burdens.

Case Summary




Overview
HOLDINGS: [1]-Where employees' religious practice of weekly observing the Sabbath by refraining from work from sundown Friday through sunset Saturday conflicted with their employer's requirement that its production employees work every other Saturday, disputed issues of material fact remained, requiring resolution by the trier of fact, in the employees' Title VII suit; [2]-Title VII required the employer reasonably to accommodate the employees' religious practice, if the employer could do so without incurring undue hardship to its business, but whether the employer had reasonably accommodated the employees' Sabbath observance by a combination of allowing them to use their vacation and other paid time off, as well as permitting them to swap shifts with other employees, and, if not, whether the employer could do so without undue hardship, required resolution by the trier of fact.
Outcome
Decision reversed; case remanded.

HN4  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's religion. 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e-2(a)(1). The term religion includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e(j). Title VII, thus, requires that an employer, short of undue hardship, make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of its employees.

HN5  Burdens of Proof, Burden Shifting
A version of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis aids courts in addressing failure to accommodate religious practices questions. At the first step of that analysis, it is the employee's burden to establish a prima facie claim by showing that 1) the employee has a bona fide religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement, 2) the employee informed the employer of this conflict; and 3) the employer fired the employee for failing to comply with the job requirement.

Labor &amp; Employment Law &gt; ... &gt; Religious Discrimination &gt; Defenses &gt; Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
HN6  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
Title VII requires that an employer, short of undue hardship, make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of its employees. Accommodate means allowing the plaintiff to engage in her religious practice despite the employer's normal rules to the contrary.

HN7  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
To be reasonable, a religious accommodation need not provide a total accommodation. Although an employee is not required to modify his religious beliefs, a reasonable accommodation need not be on the employee's terms, only.

Labor &amp; Employment Law &gt; ... &gt; Religious Discrimination &gt; Defenses &gt; Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
HN8  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
Any reasonable religious accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation. An employee is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice. Once the employer has provided a reasonable accommodation, it need not further show that each of the employee's alternative accommodations would result in undue hardship.

HN9  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
Title VII expressly requires only that an employer reasonably accommodate an employee's religion, 42 U.S.C.S. § 2000e(j). Determining what is reasonable is a fact-specific determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis.

Labor &amp; Employment Law &gt; ... &gt; Religious Discrimination &gt; Defenses &gt; Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
HN10  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices—that they be treated no worse than other practices. Rather, it gives them favored treatment, affirmatively obligating employers not to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual because of such individual's religious observance and practice. An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear policy as an ordinary matter. But when an applicant requires an accommodation as an aspect of religious practice, it is no response that the subsequent failure to hire was due to an otherwise-neutral policy. Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.

HN11  Defenses, Reasonable Accommodation &amp; Undue Hardship
An employer cannot take refuge behind a neutral policy if something more is required reasonably to accommodate a religious need. An employer can, of course, meet its obligation to accommodate its employees' religious practice by using a neutral policy, so long as that policy reasonably accommodates the employee's religious needs. Nothing in Title VII requires the accommodation uniquely to target a religious concern. But, on the other hand, if a general policy does not amount to a reasonable accommodation of the employee's religious needs, then merely having a neutral employment policy will not absolve the employer of its Title VII obligation reasonably to accommodate its employee's religious practices, short of an undue hardship. Were that not so, the 'reasonable accommodation requirement could not accomplish its intended objective. Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.

An employer incurs an undue hardship if it must bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give an employee Saturdays off to observe his Sabbath. Any cost in efficiency or wage expenditure that is more than de minimis constitutes undue hardship. The cost of hiring an additional worker or the loss of production that results from not replacing a worker who is unavailable due to a religious conflict can amount to undue hardship. It is the employer's burden to show that it cannot offer a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship. Whether an employer will incur an undue hardship is a fact question that turns on the particular factual context of each case.

Opinion




 [*546]  EBEL, Circuit Judge.
Plaintiffs Richard Tabura and Guadalupe Diaz (&quot;Plaintiffs&quot;) are Seventh Day Adventists who honor the Sabbath by refraining from work each week from Friday at sundown [**2]  through sundown Saturday. That religious practice conflicted with their job schedules at a food production plant operated by Defendant Kellogg USA, Inc. (&quot;Kellogg&quot;). Eventually Kellogg terminated each Plaintiff for not working their Saturday shifts. Plaintiffs allege that in doing so, Kellogg violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by failing to accommodate their Sabbath observance. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion and granted Kellogg summary judgment, concluding as a matter of law both that Kellogg did reasonably accommodate Plaintiffs' religious practice and, alternatively, that Kellogg  [*547]  could not further accommodate their Sabbath observance without incurring undue hardship. We conclude, on the record before us, that the district court erred in granting Kellogg summary judgment; however, on that same record, the district court did not err in denying Plaintiffs summary judgment. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, therefore, we REVERSE summary judgment for Kellogg and REMAND for further proceedings.
I. BACKGROUND
When Plaintiffs began working at the food production plant in Clearfield, Utah, they worked Monday through Thursday, ten hours [**3]  a day. Plaintiffs continued with that schedule after Kellogg took over the plant in 2007. In March 2011, however, Kellogg changed its shift schedule, adopting &quot;continuous crewing&quot; by dividing the plant's workforce into four shifts, designated A, B, C, and D. Each shift worked twelve hours a day for two or three days, and then would have two or three days off. Tabura and Diaz worked on Shift A, a day shift that included approximately twenty-five to thirty employees who worked from 6 a.m. to 6 or 6:30 p.m. Tabura was among the twelve to fifteen employees on Shift A who worked in processing; Diaz and the others worked in packaging. Shift A was paired with Shift C, whose members worked at night, from 6 or 6:30 p.m. to 6 or 6:30 a.m. B and D Shifts were similarly paired, one working days and the other nights when Shifts A and C were off.
Each of the four shifts had to work every other Saturday, or twenty-six Saturdays each year. Plaintiffs informed Kellogg that they could not work on Saturdays because it was their Sabbath. During the winter months, Plaintiffs had a further conflict finishing their shifts on Fridays when the sun set before their shift ended. Kellogg permitted Plaintiffs to [**4]  avoid these scheduling conflicts by using paid vacation and sick/personal time and arranging to swap shifts with other employees. These options were available to any employee who wanted to take a day off for any reason.
Although Plaintiffs could swap shifts with other workers, there were difficulties in doing so. Plaintiffs had to arrange their own swaps, the swapping employees had to be qualified to perform each other's jobs, and Kellogg had to approve the swap. Swapping was further complicated because, for safety reasons, Kellogg would not permit an employee to work more than thirteen straight hours, so Plaintiffs could not swap with anyone on C Shift, the night shift that followed Plaintiffs' Shift A. Instead, Plaintiffs had to find someone from either Shift B or D. But Plaintiffs were not at the plant at the same time as those shifts, and the D night shift members would have had to alter their sleep schedules in order to work the A day shift.
Kellogg assessed disciplinary points against any employee who missed part or all of a scheduled work day without taking paid time off or trading shifts with another employee, or who failed to give adequate notice of an absence: four points for [**5]  an absence for which the employee did not give Kellogg at least two hours' notice, two points for an absence that was not pre-approved if the employee called in at least two hours before his shift began, and one point for arriving late, leaving early, or taking too long a lunch break. Accumulating too many points would trigger progressive disciplinary measures: Generally ten points would result in a verbal warning, twelve points would result in a written warning, and fourteen points would result in a &quot;final warning.&quot; Kellogg would fire an employee if he accumulated sixteen disciplinary points in any twelve-month period,  [*548]  once the progressive disciplinary steps had been exhausted.
A. Richard Tabura
Tabura's job on Shift A was to measure spices. He annually earned 160 hours of paid time off (vacation and sick/personal days), which would cover a little over thirteen of the twenty-six twelve-hour Saturday shifts he would have to work in a year. And if he timely informed Kellogg he was going to take off the other thirteen Saturdays without pay, Tabura would accumulate twenty-six disciplinary points in a twelve-month period, well over the sixteen points that would result in his termination. [**6]  Tabura, therefore, had to find other qualified workers to swap shifts with him. Tabura was able to arrange only three shift swaps. But those employees either were not qualified to do Tabura's job, or vice versa, so he could not continue swapping with them. When Tabura amassed seventeen disciplinary points in a twelve-month period—many for not working on his Sabbath, but a few for other reasons—and after exhausting the progressive disciplinary steps, Kellogg fired Tabura in March 2012, a year after Kellogg went to &quot;continuous crewing.&quot;
B. Guadalupe Diaz
Diaz worked on Shift A placing frozen vegetarian burgers in bags and conducting quality control. She earned 200 hours of paid time off each year (vacation and sick/personal days), which would almost cover seventeen of the twenty-six Saturdays she had to work each year.1  And if she timely informed Kellogg that she was going to take the remaining nine Saturdays off without pay, Diaz would accumulate eighteen disciplinary points within a twelve-month period, just over the sixteen points for which Kellogg would fire her.
When Kellogg first went to &quot;continuous crewing,&quot; Diaz arranged to swap her Saturday shifts for the Sunday shifts assigned [**7]  to another employee who observed the Sabbath on Sunday. That worked well for several months until the other employee left Kellogg. After that, Diaz spoke to several other employees about swapping shifts, without luck. At one point, she was able to arrange for another employee to cover her shift for a single Saturday.
Diaz refused to use her vacation and paid time off in order to avoid working on Saturdays. She chose, instead, to use her vacation time to visit her gravely ill sister, and to save her sick time for when she was ill. After Diaz accumulated more than sixteen disciplinary points for missing Saturday shifts, and after she exhausted the progressive discipline steps, Kellogg fired Diaz in May 2012.
C. This litigation
Plaintiffs sued Kellogg under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e through 2000e-17, asserting three claims for relief: 1) disparate treatment based on religion; 2) failure to accommodate Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance; and 3) retaliation. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion and granted Kellogg summary judgment on each of these three claims. On appeal, Plaintiffs challenge the district court's rulings only as to their failure-to-accommodate claim. [**8]  They argue that the district court erred both in granting Kellogg summary judgment on that claim and in denying Plaintiffs summary judgment.2  As explained  [*549]  below, we conclude that neither side is entitled to summary judgment.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
This court reviews the district court's summary judgment decisions de novo. See Owings v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 873 F.3d 1206, 1212 (10th Cir. 2017). A court &quot;shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). &quot;Where, as here, we are presented with cross-motions for summary judgment, we must view each motion separately, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.&quot; Fox v. Transam Leasing, Inc., 839 F.3d 1209, 1213 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).
III. DISCUSSION
Title VII makes it &quot;unlawful . . . for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . religion . . . .&quot; 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). &quot;The term 'religion' includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer [**9]  demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate . . . an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.&quot; Id. § 2000e(j). Title VII, thus, requires that &quot;an employer, short of 'undue hardship,' make 'reasonable accommodations' to the religious needs of its employees.&quot; Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 66, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 53 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1977) (&quot;TWA&quot;).3EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2031-32, 192 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015) 
The questions presented here, then, are whether Kellogg reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs' religious practice of not working on their Sabbath and, if not, whether Kellogg could have done so without undue hardship to its business. A version of the McDonnell Douglas4McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)  burden-shifting analysis aids us in addressing these questions. See Thomas v. Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers, 225 F.3d 1149, 1155-56 n.6 (10th Cir. 2000). At the first step of that analysis, it is the employee's burden to establish a prima facie claim by showing that 1) the employee has a bona fide religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement, 2) the employee informed the employer of this conflict; and 3) the employer fired the employee for failing to comply with the job requirement. See id. at 1155. The parties do not challenge this rendition of a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim.
Here, Kellogg assumed, for purposes of summary judgment, [**10]  that Plaintiffs each made a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim: 1) Each Plaintiff has a bona fide religious practice—observing the Sabbath by refraining from work, beginning on Friday at sundown through sundown on Saturday—that conflicted with Kellogg's requirement that its production employees  [*550]  work every other Saturday; 2) each Plaintiff informed Kellogg of this conflict; and 3) Kellogg fired Plaintiffs for failing to work their scheduled Saturday shifts.5Baker v. Home Depot, 445 F.3d 541, 546 (2d Cir. 2006)Cooper v. Oak Rubber Co., 15 F.3d 1375, 1379 n.1 (6th Cir. 1994)  The district court accepted Kellogg's limited concession, for summary judgment purposes, that each Plaintiff established a prima facie claim; we do, too, for purposes of this appeal. See Lee v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 22 F.3d 1019, 1022 (10th Cir. 1994).
The burden then shifted to Kellogg 1) to rebut an element of Plaintiffs' prima facie claims; 2) to show that it provided a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiffs' religious practice; or 3) to show that it could not offer a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship. Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1156. In granting Kellogg summary judgment, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that Kellogg reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance and, alternatively, that Kellogg would incur an undue hardship if it further accommodated their religious [**11]  practice. We disagree on both counts.
A. Reasonable accommodation
1. Relevant law
a. Reasonableness of an accommodation
Title VII requires that &quot;an employer, short of 'undue hardship,' make 'reasonable accommodations' to the religious needs of its employees.&quot; TWA, 432 U.S. at 66. &quot;Accommodate . . . means . . . allowing the plaintiff to engage in her religious practice despite the employer's normal rules to the contrary.&quot; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 135 S. Ct. at 2032 n.2; see also US Airways v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 400, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) (Americans with Disabilities Act (&quot;ADA&quot;) case).
In this case, an accommodation will not be reasonable if it only provides Plaintiffs an opportunity to avoid working on some, but not all, Saturdays. See Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 70, 107 S. Ct. 367, 93 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986). Nor would it be reasonable if Kellogg only provided Plaintiffs with an opportunity to delay their eventual termination. See id. at 70-71; see also Pinsker v. Joint Dist. No. 28J of Pinsker, 735 F.2d 388, 390-91 (10th Cir. 1984) (upholding trial court's finding that employer's leave policy reasonably accommodated employee's need not to work on several holy days where the policy &quot;jeopardized neither [the employee's] job nor his observation of religious holidays&quot;).
On the other hand, to be reasonable, an accommodation need not provide a &quot;total&quot; accommodation; that is, Kellogg is not required to guarantee Plaintiffs will never be scheduled [**12]  for a Saturday shift, nor is Kellogg required to provide an accommodation &quot;that spares the employee any cost whatsoever,&quot; Pinsker, 735 F.2d at  [*551]  390-91; see also Brener v. Diagnostic Ctr. Hosp., 671 F.2d 141, 145-46 n.3 (5th Cir. 1982) (holding that, although &quot;[o]f course, an employee is not required to modify his religious beliefs,&quot; &quot;[a] reasonable accommodation need not be on the employee's terms, only&quot;).
&quot;[A]ny reasonable accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation.&quot; Ansonia, 479 U.S. at 68. An employee is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice. Id. Once the employer has provided a reasonable accommodation, it &quot;need not further show that each of the employee's alternative accommodations would result in undue hardship.&quot; Id.
b. Inapplicable or unhelpful tests proposed by the parties
Plaintiffs and Amicus EEOC attempt to engraft additional broad rules that would complicate this otherwise straightforward case-specific analysis. We decline to adopt their proffered per se rules, at least in the factual context of this case. Nor do we agree with Plaintiffs and the EEOC that the Supreme Court has, in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, changed the straightforward statutory analysis called for here.
i. Analyzing whether a reasonable accommodation is a &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;total&quot; accommodation [**13]  is not helpful here
Plaintiffs and Amicus EEOC first invite this circuit to adopt a per se rule, which they contend several other circuits already employ, requiring that, to be reasonable, an accommodation must &quot;eliminate&quot; the conflict between the employee's religious practice and his work requirements. At times, Plaintiffs add adjectives, arguing an accommodation must &quot;actually&quot; or &quot;totally&quot; or &quot;fully and completely&quot; eliminate a conflict. (Aplt. App. 88-90, 93, 335; Aplt. Br. 34, 39.) But Title VII expressly requires only that an employer &quot;reasonably accommodate&quot; an employee's religion, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). See EEOC v. Firestone Fibers &amp; Textiles Co., 515 F.3d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 2008) (rejecting argument that Title VII requires employer &quot;to totally accommodate&quot; employee's religious practices). Determining what is reasonable is a fact-specific determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis, Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1157 n.8. Plaintiffs' absolute rule would read &quot;reasonably&quot; out of the statute. Adopting a per se &quot;elimination&quot; rule that applies across all circumstances is not helpful to determining whether an accommodation is reasonable. Instead it unnecessarily complicates the question of reasonableness and begs additional questions, including what is meant by &quot;eliminate&quot; or &quot;totally&quot; eliminate or [**14]  &quot;completely&quot; eliminate.
This total elimination idea stems from general language in Ansonia indicating that an accommodation that &quot;eliminates the conflict between employment requirements and religious practices&quot; would be reasonable. 479 U.S. at 70.6EEOC v. Tricore Reference Labs., 849 F.3d 929, 939 (10th Cir. 2017)  The Court, however, in Ansonia did not hold the reciprocal, that an accommodation could never be reasonable if it failed totally and under every conceivable fact scenario to eliminate every conflict or all tension between reasonable work requirements and religious observation. In fact, few  [*552]  things in life can be conflict-free and Title VII requires only a reasonable accommodation between religion and employment obligations. See Sturgill v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 512 F.3d 1024, 1030-31 (8th Cir. 2008).7512 F.3d at 1030Sánchez-Rodríguez v. AT&amp;T Mobility P.R., Inc., 673 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2012)Firestone Fibers &amp; Textiles, 515 F.3d at 313 
Furthermore, the Supreme Court in Ansonia did not require an accommodation to be without cost to the employee. In Ansonia, an employee needed six days off for religious observance. 479 U.S. at 62-63. The governing collective bargaining agreement provided employees with three paid days off for religious observance, but prohibited an employee from using other paid time off for religious reasons. Id. at 63-64. The Supreme Court ultimately remanded that case for further factual inquiry into whether the employer's accommodation was reasonable. [**15]  Id. at 66, 70. In doing so, however, the Court importantly noted that the employer's policy of requiring an employee
to take unpaid leave for holy day observance that exceeded the amount allowed by the collective-bargaining agreement, would generally be a reasonable one. In enacting [42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j)], Congress was understandably motivated by a desire to assure the individual additional opportunity to observe religious practices, but it did not impose a duty on the employer to accommodate at all costs. [TWA], 432 U.S. 63 . . . (1977). The provision of unpaid leave eliminates the conflict between employment requirements and religious practices by allowing the individual to observe fully religious holy days and requires him only to give up compensation for a day that he did not in fact work. Generally speaking, &quot;[t]he direct effect of [unpaid leave] is merely a loss of income for the period the employee is not at work; such an exclusion has no direct effect upon either employment opportunities or job status.&quot; Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136, 145, 98 S. Ct. 347, 54 L. Ed. 2d 356 . . . (1977).
Ansonia, 479 U.S. at 70-71 (emphasis added; citing TWA, 432 U.S. 63).
Several circuits have applied this &quot;elimination&quot; language in a specialized context where an employee had two religious practices that conflicted with his job requirements, but the employer attempted to accommodate [**16]  only one of those two practices. For example, in Smith v. Pyro Mining Co., the Sixth Circuit held that, while the employer attempted to accommodate its employee's religious practice of not working on the Sabbath, by permitting the employee to ask others to trade shifts, the employer did not attempt to accommodate the employee's second conflict, his religious belief that it is a sin to ask others to work on the Sabbath. 827 F.2d 1081, 1088 (6th Cir. 1987). Thus, the Sixth Circuit concluded the employer's attempted accommodation in that case failed to eliminate both conflicts. Id.8Baker v. Home Depot, Inc., 445 F.3d 541, 547-48 (2d Cir. 2006)Cooper, 15 F.3d at 1379 (6th Cir.)EEOC v. Universal Mfg. Corp., 914 F.2d 71, 73-74 (5th Cir. 1990)  References  [*553]  to &quot;eliminate,&quot; as well as &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; accommodations make sense in the situations addressed by these cases, but that is not the situation here, where Plaintiffs have only a single conflict.
Some cases invoking the &quot;elimination&quot; language do so in the unremarkable situation where the accommodation does eliminate the conflict.9Porter v. City of Chi., 700 F.3d 944, 951-53 (7th Cir. 2012)Rodriguez v. Chi., 156 F.3d 771, 775-76 (7th Cir. 1998)  In Cosme v. Henderson, on the other hand, the Second Circuit held that &quot;to be reasonable&quot; under Title VII &quot;the proposed accommodation had to have eliminated the conflict.&quot; 287 F.3d 152, 159 (2d Cir. 2002). Even so, the Second Circuit went on to consider whether other factors, nevertheless, would make unreasonable an accommodation [**17]  that eliminated the conflict. Id. at 159-60 (ultimately upholding district court's finding, made after bench trial, that employer reasonably accommodated employee's Sabbath observance). Still other courts simply invoke Ansonia's language that a reasonable accommodation eliminates the conflict, generally and without further elaboration, and then consider more specifically, as we do here, whether the accommodation at issue was reasonable under the circumstances of that particular case, without further applying the term &quot;eliminate.&quot;1Walden v. Ctrs. for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 669 F.3d 1277, 1293 (11th Cir. 2012)Morrissette-Brown v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., 506 F.3d 1317, 1318, 1320-24 (11th Cir. 2007)Wright v. Runyon, 2 F.3d 214, 217 (7th Cir. 1993)0 
In sum, courts applying language indicating that, to be reasonable, an accommodation must &quot;eliminate&quot; a conflict have done so in different ways. Further, in most cases it is not clear that these courts reached any different result than if they simply considered whether the accommodation was reasonable. In EEOC v. Ilona of Hungary, Inc., for example, the Seventh Circuit held that offering Jewish employees another day off instead of allowing them to take off Yom Kippur was not a reasonable accommodation &quot;because it does not eliminate the conflict between the employment requirement and the religious practice.&quot; 108 F.3d 1569, 1576 (7th Cir. 1996). We doubt if that case would have come out differently [**18]  if the court simply considered whether the employer's proffered accommodation was reasonable.
In any event, we see no need to adopt a per se rule requiring that an accommodation, to be reasonable, must eliminate, or totally eliminate, or completely eliminate, any conflict between an employee's religious practice and his work requirements.  [*554]  The statute requires the accommodation to be reasonable and ultimately the question of whether an accommodation is reasonable must be made on a case-by-case basis, grounded on the specific facts presented by a particular situation. See Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1157 n.8; United States v. City of Albuquerque, 545 F.2d 110, 115 (10th Cir. 1976). Further gloss on that statutory requirement adds only confusion and complexity rather than clarity.
ii. A neutral employment policy may satisfy the need for a reasonable accommodation
Plaintiffs and Amicus EEOC further suggest another per se rule, that Kellogg cannot accommodate their religious observance only through a neutral policy; that is, by the same policies available to any employee who wanted to take a day off for any reason. In making this argument, Plaintiffs and the EEOC rely on language from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. But the language on which they rely does not support such a per se rule.
As an initial matter, [**19]  Abercrombie &amp; Fitch addressed a different issue than we have here. In Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the issue was one of motivation—specifically, may an employer decline to hire an applicant when the employer is motivated to avoid the future need to accommodate that prospective employee's religious needs. See 135 S. Ct. at 2030-33. Our case, by contrast, presents a question of the effectiveness of the accommodation presented by the employer. It is readily apparent that those are two different inquiries.
The EEOC and Plaintiffs focus on the following language from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: After noting that, under Title VII, &quot;religious practice is one of the protected characteristics that cannot be afforded disparate treatment and must be accommodated,&quot; the Supreme Court stated
Nor does the statute limit disparate-treatment claims to only those employer policies that treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices. Abercrombie's argument that a neutral policy cannot constitute &quot;intentional discrimination&quot; may make sense in other contexts. But Title VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices—that they be treated no worse than other practices. Rather, it gives them favored [**20]  treatment, affirmatively obligating employers not &quot;to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual . . . because of such individual's&quot; &quot;religious observance and practice.&quot; An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear policy as an ordinary matter. But when an applicant requires an accommodation as an &quot;aspec[t] of religious . . . practice,&quot; it is no response that the subsequent &quot;fail[ure] . . . to hire&quot; was due to an otherwise-neutral policy. Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.
Id. at 2034.
This is simply a summary that recognizes an employer cannot take refuge behind a neutral policy if something more is required reasonably to accommodate a religious need. An employer can, of course, meet its obligation to accommodate its employees' religious practice by using a neutral policy, so long as that policy reasonably accommodates the employee's religious needs. Nothing in Title VII requires the accommodation uniquely to target a religious concern. See City of Albuquerque, 545 F.2d at 113-14 (upholding district court's factual finding that fire department's &quot;fairly liberal time off policy,&quot; which was available to any employee, reasonably accommodated fire fighter's [**21]  weekly Sabbath observance). But, on the other hand, if a general policy does not  [*555]  amount to a reasonable accommodation of the employee's religious needs, then merely having a neutral employment policy will not absolve the employer of its Title VII obligation reasonably to accommodate its employee's religious practices (short of an undue hardship). See Barnett, 535 U.S. at 397-98 (addressing reasonable accommodation under the ADA). &quot;Were that not so, the 'reasonable accommodation' [requirement] could not accomplish its intended objective.&quot; Id.; see also Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 135 S. Ct. at 2034 (&quot;Title VII requires otherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.&quot;).
2. Applying this relevant law to this case
We turn, then, to the specific circumstances at issue here, asking, as Title VII directs, whether Kellogg reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs' conflict between observing the Sabbath and their work schedules. Kellogg sought to accommodate Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance through a combination of allowing them to use their vacation and other paid time off, as well as permitting Plaintiffs to swap shifts with other employees. Such a combination might, under the facts of a particular case, reasonably accommodate an employee's Sabbath [**22]  observance. See Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1156-57; City of Albuquerque, 545 F.2d at 113-14. But whether an accommodation is reasonable in a given circumstance is ordinarily a question of fact to be decided by the fact finder. See City of Albuquerque, 545 F.2d at 114-15; Williams v. S. Union Gas Co., 529 F.2d 483, 488 (10th Cir. 1976). That is the case here.1City of AlbuquerqueThomas545 F.2d at 111, 113-14225 F.3d at 1156id. at 1156-57TWA, 432 U.S. at 83 n.141 
Subject to a reasonableness analysis, an employee may be required to use vacation or other paid time off to avoid conflict with religious obligations. See City of Albuquerque, 545 F.2d at 113-14 (10th Cir.). Here, however, even if Plaintiffs used all of their vacation and other paid time off, that would still have been insufficient to avoid working some scheduled Saturdays, even when considered along with accruing disciplinary points short of termination. Kellogg, of course, also permitted Plaintiffs to swap shifts with others to avoid working their Sabbath. The reasonableness of the shift-swapping accommodation, however, as well as the reasonableness of the combination of taking paid time off and swapping shifts, are critical disputed issues of material fact in this case that a jury must resolve.
Those disputes are, in part, informed by the disputed facts surrounding the difficulty Plaintiffs had in arranging voluntary swaps with other, qualified employees in  [*556]  the context [**23]  of Kellogg's &quot;continuous crewing&quot; employment practice. See McGuire v. Gen. Motors Corp., 956 F.2d 607, 608-10 (6th Cir. 1992) (reversing summary judgment and remanding for trial on question of whether employer's accommodation, that permitted employee to swap shifts in order to avoid working on his Sabbath, was reasonable in light of demonstrated difficulty employee had in arranging such voluntary shift swaps).
There is evidence indicating that the universe of qualified employees with whom each Plaintiff could swap shifts was quite limited. Plaintiffs could not swap shifts with anyone on Shift C. Kellogg's management further acknowledged it would have been &quot;challenging&quot; for Plaintiffs to swap with anyone on the other night shift, D Shift. (Aplt. App. 971.) (In fact, Tabura testified that his supervisor told Tabura that he could not swap with D Shift workers.) That left B Shift.
Tabura went to the plant during B Shift and sought to trade shifts with those workers and further asked Shift B supervisors if they knew of any employees who might be willing to swap shifts. But there were only approximately twelve to fifteen processing employees, like Tabura, on a shift. Furthermore, processing workers were not trained and qualified to perform all processing [**24]  jobs. To become qualified to perform a particular job, an employee had to apply, be selected, and then study and train for two to four weeks before passing a test. Tabura identified three qualified spice room technicians that he asked to trade shifts; they each usually declined. Tabura was able to arrange a total of three swaps, but it turned out he was unable to do the jobs of two of those three swapping employees.
As for Diaz, there were similarly only about twelve to fifteen packaging employees like her on a shift. Those employees, too, had to be trained and certified for their particular jobs and were not cross-trained on every packaging job. Diaz testified that she knew of four employees who were qualified to do her job, but only two were on shifts other than hers. As soon as Kellogg announced it was going to go to &quot;continuous crewing,&quot; Diaz arranged to swap shifts with one of those four qualified employees—the Shift B employee who observed the Sabbath on Sundays—until that employee left the company. Other than those swaps, however, Diaz was only able to arrange for another worker to cover one other Saturday for her.
There is also disputed evidence as to how helpful Kellogg was [**25]  in facilitating these swap arrangements. For example, Plaintiffs' immediate supervisor Dean Shirra indicated that he gave Tabura several names of employees Tabura could speak with about trading shifts, but Shirra did not recall when he gave Tabura those names or how many names he gave Tabura. Moreover, Tabura testified that he had already asked all of the people Shirra listed as possible swaps, without success, and when he explained that to Shirra, the supervisor offered no further help. Diaz, too, testified that the only name Shirra gave her to ask about swapping shifts was someone she had already asked.
Although, under the undisputed facts presented in Thomas, we rejected the argument that the employer in that case &quot;should have provided more active assistance in helping [the employee] locate a 'voluntary permanent swap' for Saturdays,&quot; we also recognized that there may be facts present in a given case that could &quot;require an employer to take a more active role in securing a voluntary swap for the employee.&quot; 225 F.3d at 1156-57 n.8. On the record here, we think a jury could find that, in light of the difficulties Plaintiffs had in arranging shift swaps in  [*557]  this case, Kellogg had to take a more active role [**26]  in helping arrange swaps in order for that to be a reasonable accommodation of Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance.
Of course, an employee has a duty to cooperate with his employer's attempts to accommodate the employee's religious practices. See Toledo v. Nobel-Sysco, Inc., 892 F.2d 1481, 1488 (10th Cir. 1989) (citing Ansonia, 479 U.S. at 69); see also Lee 22 F.3d at 1022. As to that question, too, there remain genuinely disputed issues of material fact. Kellogg contends, for example, that Plaintiffs really made no effort to use the accommodations Kellogg offered them. But Plaintiffs provided evidence that they did make some attempts, for example, to seek out approvable shift swaps. A jury will have to decide to what extent Plaintiffs attempted to use the accommodations Kellogg provided and whether any such efforts satisfied Plaintiffs' reasonable duty to cooperate. See Beadle v. Hillsborough Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 29 F.3d 589, 593 (11th Cir. 1994) (upholding factual finding, after trial, that the employee &quot;failed to take full advantage&quot; of the shift-swapping accommodation offered by the employer); Brener, 671 F.2d at 143, 145 (5th Cir.) (upholding trial court's factual finding that employee &quot;made only haphazard efforts to arrange schedule trades,&quot; which was one of the accommodations the employer provided to permit the employee to observe his Sabbath and religious holy days); McGuire, 956 F.2d at 610 (6th Cir.) (reversing summary judgment for [**27]  employer and remanding for trial in part on disputed fact question of whether employee failed to seek voluntary swaps, which were part of the accommodation his employer provided).
The above recitation makes it clear that in this case there are a multitude of genuinely disputed material facts regarding whether Kellogg reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance.12  In light of that, neither Kellogg nor Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this defense.
B. Undue hardship
Kellogg also pled the affirmative defense that any additional accommodation of Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance would cause undue hardship to Kellogg's business. The district court alternatively granted Kellogg summary judgment on that defense. An employer incurs an undue hardship if it must &quot;bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give [an employee] Saturdays off&quot; to observe his Sabbath. TWA, 432 U.S. at 84. &quot;Any cost in efficiency or wage expenditure that is more than de minimis constitutes undue hardship. The cost of hiring an additional worker or the loss of production that results from not replacing a worker who is  [*558]  unavailable due to a religious conflict can amount to undue hardship.&quot; Lee, 22 F.3d at 1023 (internal quotation marks, [**28]  citation omitted); see also TWA, 432 U.S. at 84. It is the employer's burden to show that it cannot offer a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship. See Thomas, 225 F.3d at 1156. Whether an employer will incur an undue hardship is a fact question, see Williams, 529 F.2d at 488, that turns on &quot;the particular factual context of each case,&quot; Toledo, 892 F.2d at 1490 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, we have several concerns about upholding summary judgment for Kellogg on its undue-hardship defense. First and foremost, while Kellogg pled that affirmative defense, Kellogg did not move for summary judgment on it. Even so, the district court can grant summary judgment on that basis if the court first gives the parties &quot;notice and a reasonable time to respond.&quot; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(2). But the court did not give notice in this case. The parties, therefore, were not on notice to put forth all of their evidence pertaining to Kellogg's undue-hardship defense. Plaintiffs, in moving for summary judgment, did address the undue-hardship question to some extent, proffering ways Kellogg might have accommodated them without apparent undue hardship. But they did so expressly in light of the fact that, at trial, it was Kellogg who would bear the burden of proving its undue-hardship defense. Kellogg, [**29]  for its part, in opposing summary judgment for Plaintiffs, asserted only that &quot;several of Plaintiffs' proposed alternative accommodations would create significant burdens on the company in the form of unauthorized overtime, quality control issues, and even forcing entire lines to shut down.&quot; (Aplt. App. 254.) Kellogg did not otherwise cite to any evidence to support its assertions. The parties, therefore, did not put forth all of their evidence on Kellogg's undue-hardship defense. Given these concerns, summary judgment was not warranted for either side on the record before us.
IV. CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs' religious practice of weekly observing the Sabbath by refraining from work from sundown Friday through sunset Saturday conflicted with Kellogg's requirement that its production employees work every other Saturday. Title VII required Kellogg reasonably to accommodate Plaintiffs' religious practice, if Kellogg could do so without incurring undue hardship to its business. Whether Kellogg reasonably accommodated Plaintiffs' Sabbath observance and, if not, whether Kellogg could do so without undue hardship, must await further proceedings. We, therefore, REVERSE the district court's decision [**30]  granting Kellogg summary judgment on Plaintiffs' failure-to-accommodate claims and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

            <Comments>1 In their appellate brief, Plaintiffs assert that Tabura and Diaz each had 160 hours of paid time off, citing Kellogg's policy manual. But the parties' undisputed facts before the district court indicated, instead, that Diaz earned 200 hours paid time off annually.
2 On appeal, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (&quot;EEOC&quot;) filed an amicus brief on Plaintiffs' behalf and participated in oral argument.
3 The Supreme Court, in , indicated that a &quot;failure to accommodate&quot; claim is a claim for &quot;disparate treatment&quot; and thus must ultimately satisfy the general elements of a &quot;disparate treatment&quot; claim.
4 .
5 Despite conceding that each Plaintiff made a prima facie claim, on appeal Kellogg points out that it fired Tabura after he amassed more than sixteen disciplinary points, and Kellogg assessed the last two points, not when Tabura missed a Saturday shift, but instead when he clocked in late after lunch on two occasions. Even so, there is evidence in the record from which a jury could find that all but two of the sixteen disciplinary points leading to Tabura's termination were for missing his Saturday shifts. Moreover, other circuits conclude that a plaintiff can satisfy the third prong of his prima facie claim by showing he was disciplined or threatened with termination, rather than actually being fired, for failing to comply with a work requirement that conflicts with his religious practice. See, e.g., ; . We do not have to rule definitively on that issue, however, because in any event, Kellogg cannot now retract its concession in the district court that, for purposes of the summary-judgment motions, Tabura made a prima facie claim.
6 The EEOC also points to its own compliance manual, which &quot;states that an '[e]mployer violates Title VII if it offers only a partial accommodation where full accommodation would not pose an undue hardship.'&quot; (EEOC Br. 11 (quoting EEOC Compliance Manual § 12 (Religious Discrimination) (July 22, 2008))). We consider this argument, too, although the EEOC's Compliance Manual &quot;is not entitled to special deference.&quot; .
7 Sturgill held that &quot;[w]hat is reasonable depends on the totality of the circumstances and therefore might, or might not, require elimination of a particular, fact-specific conflict.&quot; . The First Circuit has cited Sturgill and this standard. See . In addition, the Fourth Circuit, as previously mentioned, has rejected the &quot;elimination&quot; standard. See .
8 See also  (holding scheduling employee for later shift on Sunday so he could attend church did not eliminate conflict with his second religious practice of not working at all on Sunday, his Sabbath);  (same);  (holding employer did not reasonably accommodate employee's religious practices, where employer accommodated employee's request to attend religious festival during scheduled work shift but did not address employee's second religious practice of refraining from work during the week of the festival).
9 See  (holding accommodation—changing to late shift—that eliminated conflict by allowing employee to attend religious services was reasonable);  (holding police department's offer for officer, who objected for religious reasons to being assigned to guard abortion clinic, to transfer to another district that would not require such duty was a reasonable accommodation because it would have eliminated conflict).
10 See  (holding, after stating that a reasonable accommodation eliminates the conflict, that employer reasonably accommodated employee counselor, whose religious views precluded her from counselling individuals involved in a same sex romantic relationship, by removing employee from counselling position and offering to help her find new, non-counselling position within the agency);  (after stating that &quot;a reasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the conflict,&quot; upholding district court's factual finding, made after bench trial, that employer reasonably accommodated employee's Sabbath observance through, among other things, rotating shifts and by permitting employee to swap shifts and providing her with information as to her co-workers' schedules); see also .
11 Based on this Court's earlier decisions in  and , Kellogg incorrectly asserts a per se rule that the accommodations it offered Plaintiffs are reasonable as a matter of law. In City of Albuquerque, however, this Court upheld the district court's factual finding, made after a trial, that the fire department reasonably accommodated its employee's Sabbath observance. . In Thomas, this Court affirmed summary judgment for the employer (without requiring a trial) where the employer permitted the employee to use paid leave to avoid working on his Sabbath, would have approved voluntary shift swaps when the employee could arrange them, and unsuccessfully sought a waiver from the union to change his schedule. . In Thomas, however, it was undisputed that the additional accommodations the employee suggested that would enable him to avoid having to work any Sabbath would have violated an agreement between the union and the employer. See . And Title VII's requirement that an employer reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practices does not obligate the employer to violate a collective bargaining agreement. See . Here, by contrast, there is no collective bargaining agreement that restricts the accommodations Kellogg can offer.
12 There are many other factual discrepancies throughout the record that may also prove to be material. For example, although Kellogg asserts it accommodated Plaintiffs, in part, by letting them use vacation and other paid time off to avoid working Saturdays, Tabura testified in his deposition that his supervisor Shirra did not tell Tabura he could use vacation time until after Tabura had already accumulated ten disciplinary points for missing his Saturday shifts. And, according to Tabura, Supervisor Shirra never told Tabura he could also use sick time to avoid working on Saturdays, although there appears to be conflicting evidence on this point as well. Further, while there is evidence Plaintiffs informed Kellogg of their need for a religious accommodation, and Kellogg conceded as much for summary-judgment purposes, Plaintiffs' supervisor testified in his deposition that he was unaware that Tabura needed to avoid working Saturday shifts for religious reasons until Supervisor Shirra gave Tabura a verbal warning after he accumulated ten disciplinary points. Furthermore, Shirra testified he was never aware that Diaz needed to avoid working Saturdays for religious reasons.</Comments>
